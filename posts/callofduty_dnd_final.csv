CallOfDuty,IceKing97,0,"[COD] when is the Black Ops 2020 reveal? So I've been hearing rumours about the COD Black Ops 2020 Reveal, some people are saying it won't be until mid june, others are saying it won't be until the PS5 event.  But I don't know who to trust, it certainly isn't today. But I wonder when it is because a lot of COD Reveals were in May by the latest. People say it's been changed by the Coronavirus, the fact that Warzone and Season 4 are popular, and the PS5 event is around the corner.

&amp;#x200B;

When do you guys think it is? 

A: PS5 Reveal

B: Mid June

C: After Warzone and Season 4.",0

CallOfDuty,HugoSmileCZE,0,"[COD] WW2 free COD points? Hi, I have question about COD points for PS+ users... On one Slovakian gaming page, they said that now, since the WW2 is on ps+ for free, you download it and it will give you free 1100 COD points. Anyway, me and my friends (who mostly plays warzone) didn't get any points... As I was researching this topic, it turned out to be only if you have gold edition, and on ps+ is normal edition... so, you need gold edition to get that points or is there some other way?
(And no I don't need the points, but it would be nice since new battlepass is coming in warzone, and I already bought thousands of points on warzone since start, so some free would come in handy)

CallOfDuty,TheOfficeFan02,2,"[COD] Bring back supply drops but in a non pay to win way Okay, so before you downvote me for saying the forbidden words supply drops here is a way I think they can bring it back.

So, first off let‚Äôs get the pay to win out of the way. The supply drops will drop COSMETIC items only like camos, blueprints and costumes for your character and etc. weapons will be added just like in MW. You can do a challenge or get it in the battle pass.

My only problem with MW is the fact that you can‚Äôt get most of the cosmetics without putting your credit card info in. No thanks IW I don‚Äôt want to spend $20 so my enemy glows purple once I gun them down. I think they should add these to the supply drops so ALL players can get them through gameplay not through credit cards. I get jealous seeing people run around with cool ass looking guns then realize you have to pay $20 to get them and there is no other way. It‚Äôs sucks. I know people will say ‚ÄúBuT iTs CoSMeTiC oNlY!‚Äù Who cares? Cosmetic items should be earned through gameplay no matter what. They look cool and I would like to use them. It gets boring seeing people play Star Wars while you‚Äôre standing there with a weapon that shoots bullets and not laser beams. I want it and so so many other players but can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs expensive and quite useless to spend money on but people do it regardless. 

Anyways.

BUT what if you want that skin right now? Well, they can add something in where you can buy it for a specific amount of cod points. That way if you don‚Äôt want to gamble and waste your precious gaming time you can just purchase it right then and there in a couple of seconds. That way IW, Treyarch, sledgehammer, or whoever is developing the game will still get money through the battle pass, weapon skins, and ability to buy supply drops. 

Not sure if any CoD devs will see this but I think it‚Äôs just a little suggestion to make the game a little bit more open to players. Also, bring back prestige mode please I miss it.",0

I mostly play BO2 but I'm open to BO, WaW, and MW3. Also really love zombies but I'm a bit more on the novice side unless it's town survival lol. If you'd like to see any of my old intros for whatever, just pm. 

Hope you're all well :)

The PlayStation event is rumoured to take place on June 3rd. Season 4 of MW is also starting on June 3rd so I think during the PlayStation event we'll see a full release/reveal of Season 4, the PS5 lineup of games / console reveal as well as a COD 2020 reveal.",0

1  
We will play as Reznov after he ESCAPES from Vorkuta  
many people were mad that bo4 rewrites the original story because  
in one of the bo4 tapes, we learn that Reznov indeed survived but  
are they REwriting the story because we never actually learn if  
he's dead thanks to his bo2 cameo so if he survived  
what he did between escaping from Vorkuta and then saving again Mason in the dessert.  
2  
We will play again as Alex Mason because the canon ending of bo2 is the one  
where Mason survives but what was doing those 30 years I think that would be the story.

Even with variants that come with permanent attachments to the weapon, like the AK-12 R.I.P. variant, which comes with a red dot,.it's still not able to be used. We both tried to grind for the sights back, but to no avail. The game won't even let us see the progress on getting the attachments. And, also oddly enough, it left us with six different attachments, extended mags, parabolic microphone, rapid fire, foregrip, advanced rifling, and fast mags, I believe.

CallOfDuty,rainbowedgum,33,"[COD] My parents not getting me cod infinite warfare Hello. My parents have never ever wanted me to ever have cod.

 Here's what I want to discuss today. 

Why am I not aloud cod infinite warfare? Is it even that bad at all? Any time I try to talk to them about it they just say, "" we aren't having this conversation"" i can never even mention it without them getting mad. I have tried writing a pursasive where a made up a game called ""b battle 3"" and described everything in call of duty infinite warfare as if it was "" b battle 3"" they then said yes I can get the game. Then i revealed that everything I just described was the game cod infinite warfare. They immediately said no.

I feel the only reason they are not getting me the game is because of its name. all of my freinds play it and I feel I'm missing our BIG TIME. They are in denial. Even in the websites where they recommend the age for it they say 12+ and I'm 13!! This is ridiculous. I really just want advice on the situation. Can any of you help me.

CallOfDuty,DMmaster5E,2,"[COD] I think there‚Äôs a visual bug regarding the 23‚Äù Romanian barrel on the AK-47 in Modern Warfare(2019) The Romanian barrel features a built-in foregrip, and makes it so that you cannot have underbarrel attachments. 

I noticed that while in-game, your character doesn‚Äôt hold the foregrip, and instead places their hand the way they would hold the default barrel, which makes it so the foregrip is protruding through their hand. 

Is this a bug, or was this an intentional design choice?",0

With some of the best guns in CoD like the honey Badger or Ripper. Ghost also did something way different, Aliens, not just same old zombies every year. The kill streaks, some of the best we had. Yes camping, EODs, time to kill, forgettable campaign, but come on can we at least appreciate it.",0
CallOfDuty,RuggedSavior,5,"[COD] Opinion: Secondary launchers should come to an end; UAV changes The reason is because I personally feel **launchers destroy the flow of gunfights due to how cheesy they can with easy kills**.  You'll always have that one game where everyone will be exchanging small arms fire, only for someone to constantly spam RPGs.  I understand some games will offer resistances like Flak Jacket or Trophy Systems, but I feel the **launchers make certain counters too essential in order to provide a somewhat proper counter**.  In some games, we may not even get to use trophy systems due to the time period within the games.  If COD2020 rumors are correct, that means we won't be getting the trophy system in the Vietnam Era of the 1960's.

Of course, the big question follows; What about UAVs?  For them, I would suggest my one idea, which is to **make them invisible like they were in COD4 and WaW**.  However, the streak would work differently by **only allowing the user to mark enemies on radar with their own vision instead of sweeping the entire map**.  That way, the streak can be properly balanced due to the main counter (launchers) being MIA, along with making the Anti-UAV perks less required to survive.  As for other streaks like helicopters, the proper counter would be simple bullet damage, FMJ rounds, or to **make launchers as a streak** (similar to how Ghosts added the MAAWS).

[The MAAWS was a support streak that appears in Call of Duty: Ghosts \(2013\)](https://preview.redd.it/038rm1bn58151.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b552b7519516d293099941400efe13f7aa63a5eb)

The biggest factor in having no launchers, aside preventing spam, is to rid myself and a few other from constantly having to destroy UAVs.  It's quite annoying to constantly have to stop, look in the sky, and destroy the UAV considering how often they are spammed.  Without needing to destroy them, I can finally focus more on the combat while having a pistol to defend myself, which I find much better in case I need it.

CallOfDuty,MetalingusMike,12,"[COD] Imo in the next CoD game, the TTK should be more like Realism Mode in Modern Warfare Like many, I dislike some of the design choices of Modern Warfare 2019. Some of the features they added *could* have been great, if well implemented. Like doors for example, I wouldn‚Äôt be bothered about them if we could permanently destroy them say with a C4 or Semtex. But they are invincible and are used by players to soundwhore the majority of the time.

A problem I‚Äôve found also is with Mounting. In a headglitch you already have a massive advantage, also having lower recoil and better accuracy along with it takes the cake without having a significant downside. Many times, you can try and aim quicker and land headshots on the headglitcher and while you can have faster reaction times - even when using a high fire rate weapon, you often lose the gunfight in Core as the one or two bullets you landed on their head didn‚Äôt kill them. I think it‚Äôs bullshit personally, if you‚Äôre headglitching, I should be able to one shot headshot you. That‚Äôs balanced imo.

Anyways Treyarch in the past increased the TTK to 150% health with Black Ops 4. Many disliked it, me included. For me I disliked that even if I‚Äôm fast and accurate, my enemy can still get away and Stim, coming back to the fight with full health a moment later. I personally think players with good accuracy should be rewarded for headshots. Sort of like Rainbow Six Siege or Counter Strike GO - it takes many bullets to kill with body shots but a single bullet to the head for the kill.

What about ‚Äúlucky headshots‚Äù? Well in reality, controlling a recoil pattern perfectly in a line for a full magazine is practically impossible. An easy fix would be to offset weapon recoil to a diagonal angle.

I think you can make this in a private match (not sure), play Realism Mode against friends or bots but enable the minimap. Or heck, just play Warzone. Excluding the armour, it should feel like that. Not that I would like it, but if they adding Juggernaut back that could make sense thematically if it added a bar of armour to your player.

I just think that Modern Warfare TTK is too fast and that Treyarch was onto something with Black Ops 4, but didn‚Äôt pull through. Realism Mode and Warzone to me feel not that far from perfect imo.",0

CallOfDuty,MSPC_x499,1,"[COD] Microsoft more than likely will be pushing PC to exclusive content when they acquire the contract. Next gen, they're pushing more and more content to Xbox and PC. So Xbox and the Microsoft operating system, Windows are having a HIGH chance of getting content first. Microsoft's approach is combining more of the community for next-gen, and since their working more closely with Windows, PC and Xbox will be getting content first. Not meaning ALL operating system's, only windows. PlayStation fans, I know this is a giant kick to the balls when this happens, but exclusivity sucks. PlayStation fans back in the day got screwed over with BO1, MW2, Ghosts, and AW, now PC and Xbox is getting screwed over with BO3, IW, MWR, WWII, BO4, and MW. Let's face it. Activision is money hungry. No matter what we do, they are going to find one way or another to make some money.",0

CallOfDuty,zborro66,1,"[BO2] Multiplayer on PC is super hard I'm not a great player by any means, but I was decent on MW3 and had tons of fun. A few years ago I bought BO2 for PC and noticed that the multiplayer was really hard. I haven't played that much, I've only prestiged once and I'm at level 32 now, I've tried out all weapons and funnily enough it's still the MTAR that works best for me.

I have a fast and steady connection, but for some reason the damage is really inconsistent. Sometimes enemies (assuming they have full health) go down in a few shots, other times it takes a whole magazine to kill a guy. SMGs are peashooters that don't kill. ARs and LMGs are decent. Still, the weapons in BO2 are way less balanced than the weapons in MW3.

And a thing I can't understand is that enemies always know you're there, without UAV or sensors or anything of that sort. They just ""sense"" you and start shooting while going around a corner, almost knowing you will be there. Or sometimes I'll empty half a magazine into a guy, only for him to turn around and kill me like nothing happened. Sometimes I'll stop shooting because I heard and saw more than 4 hitboxes, yet the enemy is still alive.

I know that 80% of BO2 players are pros and have been playing for 8 years now, but holy fuck, sometimes I just want to relax and have fun and that rarely happens.",0

All maps and spawn points remain the same, weapon balance remains the same, however there are some changes I want to see made.

- One Man Army &amp; Scavenger no longer replenish explosive ammo

- Reduction to how deadly Grenade Launchers are as a whole.

- Lunge reduction to commando

- All deathstreaks removed

If they‚Äôre gonna add more content it should be through a battle pass system &amp; an in-game store if needed.
- Weapon Kits (a la MW1R)

- Character Customization

- Melee Weapons

- Ranged Weapons (Free Battle Pass)

- Camouflage Patterns (Diamond, Exclusion Zone 2.0 &amp; DLC camos)

- Weapon Gun range (a la MW1R, WW2, &amp; AW)

- Weapon Inspections (needs to be in #ModernWarfare...)

CallOfDuty,Kravchynko,3,"[COD] (POLL 2 of 5) Which 7th Generation Call of Duty would you recommend people to buy? Sorry for the huge delay in this poll's release, I just forgot to throw this one out.

The last poll, even though the community voted Black Ops 2 as the least hacked, it was only because of a bug that affected the theatre/theater mode menu. So I chose to decide Modern Warfare 3 as the winner of the last poll since it wasn't having a bug that was causing a very small amount of time of no hackers.

Poll 1: [Which 7th Gen Call of Duty is the least hacked?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/gl69ed/cod_which_7th_gen_call_of_duty_has_the_least/)

Results

1. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
2. Call of Duty: Black Ops
3. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
4. Call of Duty: World at War
5. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
6. Call of Duty: Black Ops II(like I said, I rearranged this to be more accurate to with how the current game is right now and the fact the lack of hackers was only for a small period of time and wasn't normal for current year)

Poll 2: Which 7th Generation Call of Duty would you recommend people to buy?

Poll 3: Which 7th Generation Call of Duty do you get 4 bars of connection in the most?

Poll 4: Which 7th Generation Call of Duty do you find a match the quickest in?

Poll 5: Which 7th Generation Call of Duty provides the most fun for players right now?

Like I said, Ghosts and Pre-CoD4 are excluded, the polls will close after 3 days, and I'll tally them up and rank each game by how many times it has been the top vote.

CallOfDuty,1cum,4,"[COD] Saying ‚Äúeverything was OP‚Äù in MW2 is stupid. I, and i‚Äôm sure all of you, hear this all too often...

‚ÄúIn MW2, all guns were overpowered, sure some more than others. Nowadays if you aren‚Äôt using 3-4 guns you are at a disadvantage‚Äù

Not only is this an oxymoron, but it‚Äôs stupid and untrue. 

The ‚ÄúOP‚Äù guns in MW19 have the same amount of competitive advantage as they did in MW2. The TTK difference between the OP and the other guns is very similar.

What I think it comes down to is 

A. How bad COD‚Äôs netcode and Hit Detection was in MW2, and how it contributed to random kills and deaths that had nothing to do with gunplay.

B. The lack of recoil and guns‚Äô ease of use in MW2

and, most importantly, 

C. Rose tinted goggles.

I feel like most people that regurgitate this garbage heard it from the same couple of you tubers, Act Man, Eight Thoughts, and other hyperbolic youtubers (who I like), and start spewing it at anyone on twitter or reddit that complains about the M4.

Admittedly, MW2 was fun for what it was, an early and pioneering game in the FPS genre that paved the way and inspired many aspects of FPS games today, but it‚Äôs gunplay is the last thing that people should reminisce fondly about.",0

Think halo wars but on ps4 and based on a call of duty universe.  I don‚Äôt speak for everyone by any means but hear me out. There is potentially a huge market for a ps4 strategy game similar to that of halo wars and I believe that with how big the call of duty title has gotten that it would be a perfect fit for developing such a game. It should be ps4 exclusive but rather continue the trend of have cross platform compatibility. It could be a nice trade off for the first person shooters that we get yearly.",0

So my question is. What caused the death of trickshotting? I mean in Mw2 every Search and Destroy game there was at least one trickshotter. And very frequently there was a whole clan doing it. You still saw some of it in Bo1 and Mw3 but after that it decreased massively. What are the reasons do you think? Imo it‚Äôs the snipers since being quite bad and even the CoDs in general.

CallOfDuty,HallucinatesPenguins,7,"[CoD] I miss local splitscreen and I wish they'd stop trying to force me to play online. I never played CoD for the online. I want to get that out of the way. I have literally never been the target audience for this. If you are, that's great! But I am talking from the perspective of the demo that I fall into.

I played these games for the long nights staying up at a friends houses trying to plant claymores while falling to our death from the top of rust, trying to break out of the map, or playing gun game tournaments together. I played these games for catching up with my brother when he comes back to town and forgetting about everything.

Lately, I assume Activision, has been making the call to move away from local multiplayer, removing classic modes like gun game, removing the ability to use/unlock all weapons and camos when playing local, and even more recently removing local splitscreen altogether.

If they're going to claim that the issue is performance with multiple screens (2-4) that's just absurd. there is no reason not to decrease graphics based on the number of players or even leave it up to the player what they want their graphics settings to be at and what they are capable of.

I have nowhere I am going with this. My brother is back in town and I've been working as an ""essential"" worker for minimum wage. We have been playing CoD WWII since the new game won't let us goof around together and I haven't played cod with a group of friends in quite a while. I just miss my favourite part of the game and something that a lot of us grew up on.

CallOfDuty,RuggedSavior,16,"[COD] COD 2020 needs to overhaul the scoreboard and combat records. IMO, the scoreboards barely change, but I feel it's a big factor in how people play certain modes.  The **biggest issue I have are the ""kills and deaths"" displayed in every single mode.**  It motivates people to play an OBJ mode for the wrong reasons i.e. making sure they don't go negative or boast in their killing abilities while ignoring objectives altogether.

To so fix that, I would suggest for non-ranked modes, they implement the following:

# Scoreboards should generally look like this (examples)

*TDM/FFA:  Score - Kills - KPM (kills per minute)*

*Domination:  Score - Objectives (caps and defends) - OBJ Kills (offense and defense)*

*Hardpoint:  Score - Time - OBJ kills*

*HQ:  Score - Captures - OBJ kills*

*Kill Confirmed:  Score - Confirms - Denies*

# Combat record changes

I believe that **the overall K/D ratio, W/L Ratio, total wins, and total losses should not be visibly seen** (but still tracked for the sake of skill pairings in multiplayer).  That way, there's less stress in the long-run and more motivation to play the modes without worrying about important stats.

# This only applies to non-ranked modes

What I mean is that when you play ranked modes, you WILL see a separate page of combat records that WILL show your total losses, deaths, and K/D ratios.  While I don't fully agree with it, I figure ranked players will benefit from the data.  


Overall, I feel it would benefit the community.  People won't have to worry about ""going negative"", the motivation to attain gloating rights would be based on numbers not involving KD ratios, and they won't have to worry about their negative performances after viewing the combat record.",0

I only really play multiplayer and very casually. Since 2012 I've only ever played MW2 and MW3 ( I guess don't like change). I feel like its finally time to play something different. Which do you recommend from the other available options on 360 as the best online multiplayer? Ghosts, BO1, BO2, BO3, Advanced Warfare?  Any reasons why or pros and cons would be helpful too.

I am looking for a mod menu for zombies for the blus version of the game, im positive that at least one would exist since I got my hands on but it only had a menu for multiplayer, which I'm not interested in.
I do not want to change to the bles version of the game because all my dlc's that I do own are blus I would have to redownload everything in pkg.

I mainly want the menu just to have fun, by myself and although there's that infection through edited video clips it is not permanent and I would prefer not having to sign in to psn in order to get it.

Lastly, if anyone knows of one I would like to get it pm'ed to me, to avoid possibly breaking a rule of promoting cheating.",0

There is a 44 year timeframe that this game could be set in,  from 1947-1991.   The campaign could be set throughout this whole timeframe.  This could open up multiplayer to a huge amount of weapons and prototype weapons.   From WW2 weapons that would be still in service,  like the M3 grease gun,  to familiar favourites like the steyr AUG,  MP5,  M16.  Absolutely Tonnes of possibilities that haven‚Äôt been seen in a cod before,   Like the Beretta AR70/90 and Daewoo K1, K2 etc. 

I just hope the weapon customisation is as in depth and addictive as the current Modern Warfare.   Which in my opinion is the best feature and by far the greatest create a class experience since CoD began.",0

CallOfDuty,MeatheadMario,13,"[BO2] Can we please remove theater mode from bo2 A few days ago the devs temporarily stopped theater mode in bo2. As a result there were significantly less modders which made the game more enjoyable and actually playable. However, yesterday or the day before they turned theater mode back on which meant that modders could easily access theater infections to mod. Due to this I've been getting into so many modded lobbies (some of them have mods which don't even let you leave whilst the lowlife scumbags aimbot you for a neverending game) and it is once again unplayable. The player count on bo2 doubled when theater mode was stopped and the game was playable and incredibly fun. This is one of the greatest games, not just in this franchise, but of all time and many fans would still like to play proper online matches without the disgusting modders using unfair aimbot spinning around with their no clip hamr.

I have been playing MW 2019 since December last year and I am having an absolute blast with it, I even find it the best COD I have actually played(but only out of MWR, BO3, BO4 and MW 2019). 


Meanwhile, I have heard many old-school fans talked good about MW2 on YouTube, and seen some gameplay for myself, which seems very similar to MW2019 but less refined. I believe I am not that blown away by MW2 in 2020 because I am not one of those long-time fans that experienced it in its prime, and have developed a strong sense of nostalgia and emotional attachment, so I just feel like MW2019 is better in most ways.

I just wrapped it up today, and while it was pretty generic with its story and setpieces, I enjoyed it a good deal. Definitely some stand-out moments that made the whole experience worth it. I love a good FPS campaign, so I'm curious what else you guys would recommend in this series. There are just...so many games. It's overwhelming to look at them all and try and pick.

I can most easily play anything that came out in the last two console generations. Length isn't really an issue for me, I'm really just interested in solid FPS gameplay. Bonus points for an engaging story and cast. That all said, what COD campaigns would you all recommend?",0

However, a hacker has recently went into a well known server and modified the game. I went from rank 43 to rank 50 and my game score (as well as everyone elses that wasn't the hacker) shot up to 30000. And the team score went into the negatives because of integer overflow. Then the hacker gave us all speed-hack where we could move at the speed of light. (This is the 5th hacker I've seen in a single day)

I just want to know what my chances are in not getting a VAC ban for this and if there are similar reports? (It was a VAC secured server)

CallOfDuty,jackreel1,12,"[MW2] Pro perks added a lot more flair to class customisation that modern cods are missing. The perks just seem underwhelming now and boring only doing one thing at a time. It means theres less to think about with each class. If you took scavenger you used to be able to be fine for ammo for a long streak and be trigger happy as well as being able to pick up ammo and keep being trigger happy. Now you still have to be more conserved.

Pro perks added more weight to your options because you were losing out on more abilities by choosing one perk over another - this added more depth to game as you played it which made them less boring.

I understand the balancing issues of players who grinded having more power over players who havent, but... doesnt that just make the new players want to grind? And stick with the game?

Also by giving more powerful abilities to players the more class-based the game feels like how with specialists in bo3 were broken. If you see someone running lightweight you know theyre gunna be ZOOMING around the map and they will play to that advantage. Whereas in modern warfare (2019) i can get my one flashbang back if i wait 20 seconds or i can get flashed and still be fully blinded by a flashbang even though i have the perk equipped thats supposed to lessen the effect...

More powerful perks = better gameplay (as long as theyre still balanced. Balance does not mean dumb everything down so things dont make that much of a difference to the overall gameplay. Balance is if you want to reload fast then you cant also have unlimited ammo or sprint forever (mw2 perk 1 choices))",0

It's 10 year anniversary for the Black Ops Franchise.

Instead of making an entire new game, Black Ops Cold War, Black Ops 5, or whatever the name is going to be at this point....

Why not just release a remastered edition of BO2 for current and next gen consoles?

Less work for Treyarch. All they would've need to do is upscaling the game to 4k resolution.

&amp;#x200B;

You wouldn't even need to patch many things, just take the last saved coded game from when it was in its prime. 

OF COURSE REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE THEATER MODS....

You can make sales off of something you've already made sales on lolol

Sell the base game for $50 (I mean that's fair, MWR was only $40) or sell the game with all DLC's for $100. When I say all DLC's, I mean all 4 map packs. all camo packs, all flag packs, nuketown zombies, EVERYTHING.

CallOfDuty,Warhurst06,1,"[MW] CODMW Game Keeps Crashing After Launch (v1.21) Hello everyone,

I've seen various posts about this both here and Activision forums but no fixes yet. I don't understand how is this not patched yet or no one's on top of this for a workaround.

I've been playing the game since a month with no problems, almost 5-10 hours a day. Than came the v1.21 big patch a few days ago and since than my game crashes to desktop with 3-5 seconds freeze, black screen and no errors, closely around 30 seconds - 1 minute after launch. I've tried some of the suggestions below for a fix from various other posts but **none of them worked;**

\- All Windows, DirectX, .NetFramework and Nvidia drivers up-to-date. Reinstalled latest drivers just in case.  
\- Clean uninstall and install the game (uninstalled every trace of it including registries)  
\- Deleted the contents of nv\_cache from Nvidia Corporations folder, ppsod.dat file from Documents/Call of Duty Modern Warfare/players folder and Blizzard Entertainment folder from AppData.  
\- Tried changing .exe files to .exe1 after launching the game for ModernWarfare.exe and ModernWarfareLaunch.exe from game directory and ran as admin, which redownloaded the files after crash.  
\- Scan &amp; Repair multiple times.  
\- Ran on lowest graphics possible + Safe Mode. Also ran highest possible graphics + no safe mode.  
\- Changed affinity to normal from Task Manager.  
\- Waited for game to install shaders, although it crashed every 10 seconds i kept relaunching, progressing %5-10 everytime, reaching to %100 at the end for multi/campaign/coop. To clarify; game doesn't give me enough time to wait for the shaders to install so I have to keep relaunching to make it progress.  
\- Closed all apps running background (Discord and other game platforms) and Nvidia Geforce Experience Overlay.  
\- Turned off Windows Gaming mode.  
\- Made Disk Cleanup.  
\- None of the system parts are overclocked and BIOS up-to-date.

I'm really exhausted and ran out of options. If anyone knows anyway to make it work please advise. I bought Battlepass edition, downloaded almost 400 GB and yet still can't play and it's frustrating to not know why is this happening. I'm sure it's not from my end because I've been playing it before patch just fine and I also play other games like Division 2 and Borderlands 3 with no problems.

CallOfDuty,mdhunter99,20,"[COD] Should COD Cold War (the new black ops) focus on the smaller proxy wars instead of Vietnam and the more widely known conflicts? Everyone knows about what happens in Vietnam back when the Americans invaded, ass was kicked, Americans lost, but what about the other, smaller wars at the time? Afghanistan, Ogaden region, the Congo, Laos, all wars that were influenced by the USSR and the Americans.

Should the new black ops game cover these wars? Maybe 2 playable characters 1 from both countries? Black Operations are all about organizations not taking credit for an op, it would make sense for the CIA or KGB to pull off some of their own at the time.

I attempt to download the content, and when it's done, nothing changes. It doesn't download. Every time I relaunch the game, it gives me the same message no matter what I have tried. I uninstalled the game a while back, had this issue (before that it worked just fine) when I reinstalled it. So I uninstalled it, never played it again, and now I'm here a few months later with the exact same issue.   Here's what I've tried:

 / Reinstalling the game 

/ Deleting all workshop content  

Also to note that the game was bought on G2A, I don't know if that has anything to do with this but I thought I might as well add that.  Any help or tips would be GREATLY appreciated.Message cami",0

CallOfDuty,Todredmi,9,"[COD] What would make the perfect Call of Duty? What would make the perfect Call of Duty?

So I have been pondering this question for a while, the community seems to go every which way, so these are my thoughts on the matter.

Starting with the basics.

- Map Design- 

I feel like Bo3 had some of the best maps in terms of playability, but you gotta also love big open maps like Bog. I feel that the maps shouldn‚Äôt all be strictly three lanes. Should they be as open and as fluid as MW2019‚Äôs maps? (which are all 3 lane btw) Probably not. But there should be maps that are more fluid than others. A good example of this would most likely be Azhir Cave. You have plenty of ways to be able to get around enemies but not too many. 

The maps should be made with every mode in mind. We can all agree that certain maps play better on different modes, like Piccadilly is better as a one life game mode map, and not one for TDM.

-Customization- 

There should be a huge amount of customization offered in the game, what does this entail?
- Good earnable cosmetics, that aren‚Äôt too... out there. So far, MW has done a good job with that.

- MW‚Äôs Gunsmith, another amazing addition to the game. The amount of customization that comes with each and (almost) every weapon, is great. 

- Attachment Camos- Attachments should have challenges as well. (i.e Get 100 kills shortly after ADS‚Äôing with a QuickDraw Attachment)

Paintshop/Emblem Editor- We could make some really creative camos in the paintshop/emblem editor, and I would love to see a return of this in the future.

The Mastery Camos should, be worth the grind.

- Progression- 

Challenges-The game needs to LAUNCH with dailies, weeklies and lifetime challenges. And Seasonal Challenges.

Seasons- The seasons system is a good way to give us a sense of progression, and a good way to give out DLC Weapons

Prestige- Prestiges should make a return. But have no way to reset your account.

- Weapons-

Weapons should be varied. In fact, the perfect CoD should come with EVERY weapon (except for the ultra-futuristic weapons) from every CoD. This would definitely change the grind of the mastery camo, as it would be, well a grind!

Melee weapons should simply be tied to different skins. Like how MW has started to do with the Ronin Bundle.


- The Store-

The perfect CoD, wouldn‚Äôt have a store. But alas, I know that will never happen, so the best case scenario, is to keep the store to be strictly directly purchasable items. If an item is in a bundle, it HAS to be able to be bought separately, or, we can select what we want from X bundle, and the price changes to match it.


- Gameplay-

Crossplay. Able to turned to three settings.

- No Filter (all platforms)

- Controller Only (Ps*, Xbox *, Controller Using PC Players)

- KBAM Only ( KBAM using Console Players, PC)

Predictive Recoil Patterns

Theater Mode- We need a good, bug free theater mode.

Perks-
 Perks will be categorized into three different types, with you only being able to pick one of each type, unless running Specialist.

- Passive, Perks that are just there, they don‚Äôt really change the game too much, but are a help.

      Examples: Scavenger, Restock, Hardline

- Ability, Perks that give your character an ability of some sort.

      Examples: Ghost, Dead Silence, EOD, Engineer

- Skills, Perks that help your character do stuff.

      Examples: Amped, Lightweight, Awareness


I honestly don‚Äôt think Pick 10 should return. It was quite restrictive.



So how might one want this game to come about? Well it‚Äôs really simple, actually.

Each studio does what they do best.

Treyarch Zombies and Easter Eggs

SHG Multiplayer and Weapon Design

IW Map Design.

And to top it off?

No new games. They just keep updating the same game. They make it into, THE Perfect Call of Duty.",0

I went to multiplayer to only see that I was rank one. I changed my PSN username a while ago so I put two and two together and thought nothing of it because when I used to play I was relatively bad and I saw this as an opportunity for a fresh start for my stats. I played for a while and was having tons of fun and I was going 30 in 10 in TDMs and was dropping tons of killstreaks. It was great. Today i hopped on again to only see that I‚Äôm rank one again. I played until I was level 4 and had to go somewhere so I shut off my PS3. I came back only to see my rank has been reset once again. Is my account perpetually stuck at rank one?,0

Warzone is fun but doesn‚Äôt make up for a good-good cod like the old days. I‚Äôve been playing cod since cod 4 or the original modern warfare and I really miss the good old days.

I just bought black ops II out of boredom and me and a buddy got one good night in before the theatre modders came back - so I pretty much wasted $20.  I haven't touched the modern warfare trilogy in 5 years probably, but wanted to know if it was worth buying in 2020.

CallOfDuty,leaderofwhatnation,14,"[COD] This could be a return to normalcy. With the title leaks of a new game set in the Cold War, I think that this could be a return to normalcy.

It‚Äôs widely known that most of the community who played games such as COD4, MW2 and the Black Ops Mason arch have a particular distaste for the new boost-jumping wall-running fad. But to my knowledge the Cold War didn‚Äôt spur the invention of killer robots and boot-mounted jet packs (or at least none of them came to fruition).

This could continue the stories of Alex Mason, Woods, Hudson, maybe even Bowman.

Pistols
M1911
Luger
CZ 75
9x18mm Makarov

This list does not yet include explosive equipment such as grenades, underbarrel grenade launchers, or anti tank weapons such as the ""rocket launcher."" The list may eventually be updated to include such things.

Weapons should be customizable and weapons should require maintenance, but more on that down below. Failure to clean and properly maintain your weapon and your weapon's stats will degrade with time and your rifle will jam more often.




**Campaign**

 - I want an open campaign. I mean open world. Maps don't have to be massive, but severely UNrestrictive. (Think Ghost Recon) I should be able to enter each building and tactically use it to my advantage.

 - We should be able to use 5 or more attachments on our weapons, although I think we should have access to more than 5 in the campaign. No pick 10.

 - Features like ghillie suits, using mud to mask scent from dogs and for camouflage, and taping magazines should be in the game to name a few.

 - Another redditor on here named dynamic weather and effects. I fully support this and am questioning why it isn't a big feature already. Rain should cover the sound of walking and I should be able to track and be tracked much easier in snow.

 - Enemies should be very tactical in what they do and how you interact with the environment around you the player and you should think twice before walking in their base with a machine gun, but more on that next.

 - Gunshot wounds should gravely injure you. You need to have a lot of situational awareness. If you get shot in the arm, there goes your ads speed until you can get fixed up by a combat medic. Getting shot in the leg will reduce you to slowly limping, crawling, or even death if the bullet hits an artery.

 - Teamate NPC's should work as a team alongside you. They should not be running in front of your weapon while your firing, only to die and you fail the mission. They should move in formation properly and be smart.

 - Gear should be of the time period. No molle system webbing. I don't even know if troops were using the alice system yet. Think m16a2's and ak's.

 - Crafting should be a feature. Crafting molotovs, ghillie suits, makeshift bayonets, spears, etc. etc.

 - Weapon maintenance. You should have to clean your weapon. Especially your early m16 models which were quite prone to jamming or failure to fire if they were abused in the slightest. Ak's were not as bad for sure and were much more reliable. However, Treyarch should be careful to not overcomplicate this feature. Think rdr2 weapon maintenance system.

 - Graphic situations. We as a playerbase are playing an M+ rated game. We want realism. If a shoot you in the neck, will you just fall over? Players should feel bad about killing other people. You should however be able to turn off graphic violence if Hello Kitty is also your thing.

**Multiplayer**

 - Some features such as gun maintenance should stay, but only for mil-sim game modes if there are any. What I mean is massive maps that would put warzone to shame. Ok, maybe not warzone, but 32 v 32 maps even. 

 - Violence should be just as much as in the campaign, but it should be available to be turned off for the faint of heart.

 - Maps should be for different playlists. There should be run and gun playlists and tactical playlists. For run n gun, the health situation should be like mw2019. Tactical playlist should only allow players with microphones and headsets and only for people who take the game seriously. There should be squad roles like medic/healer, sniper, spotter, (sniper + spotter only for larger maps) point man (for cqb maps), demolitions, multiple infantrymen, etc.

- Weapons should be as good as they were and are in modern warfare 2019. Get rid of the pick 10 system. That was soo 2018.

 - Milsim gamemode. Just think, multiple giant maps, the size of warzone. You could have a snowy northern Russia map, with a giant base and nuclear silo right underneath a small run down, overgrown town. Any sort of movement will leave tracks in the snow. This means walking, snowmobiles, and skis will leave different tracks that you can identify and hunt down other players. This gamemode should not have a time limit and you can leave whenever you want. You can also change your weapons and gear in the lobby before choosing to jump in the match.
Ideas for milsim maps

Snowy Russian town with a nuclear silo underneath. Map also features vast wilderness around with cabins and other structures break up the dense trees and open crop fields.

Northern Asia jungle. Extremely dense foliage allows for extreme stealth. Little villages and mud huts here and there. Rice patties also litter the map as well, giving open lines of sight to the local villages.

More maps to be added eventually...

**Infected**

 - ""Zombies"" game mode should be somewhat based in reality, so the ""zombies"" are infected with a strain of weaponized rabies or something like that.

 - keep a classic mode for nostalgic players and include old perks like jugg and mystery box, but have another game mode where you have to find weapons in a large map and defend against not only zombies, but occasionally human players or NPC's as well.

More features will be eventually added as I think of more.",0

CallOfDuty,lilninjsways,60,"[COD] Developers I know you may not be reading this but. Please do not disable cross-play. I am a PC player and all my friends are console players. I have never played with them as much as call of duty. Cause honestly the only other games are Fortnite dauntless or Minecraft. 

Even then Minecraft has limitations on ps4 still

I have played with them so much in fact that call of duty is the only game that I have 1. Max ranked every season even the pre-season. 2. Got all the tiers on every battle pass 3. Had full matches constantly after 5 months of the game releasing

PC versions of call of duty run out of players after the first 5 months of the game being released... A perfect example looks at the player counts off all the previous call of duty games. Black ops 4 they took away modes! Because there weren't enough players!!

Plus like I've said previously. One of my friends are on ps4 one is on Xbox and I am on PC and now we can finally play a good game with each other seamlessly 

Thank you Infinity ward for adding this in modern warfare 2019 but please! Pleaseee! Treyarch I know console players are crying about it and some PC players are complaining too

This is the only way most people play with all of their true friends that don't either ""have the money"" for a PC or just prefer console! 

I'm sorry to console players as a PC player that you have to deal with the shroud like players we have in our community. But trust me!! Not everyone is like that and I've honestly met so many new friends and nice people that play on console that I would've never met on PC!

CallOfDuty,oof_god4,0,For anyone struggling with launchers Okay I‚Äôm making this because getting platinum launchers to finish up Damascus is literally the hardest grind I‚Äôve had to go through. So I assume you‚Äôre reading this because you‚Äôre probably stuck on destroy ground based vehicles or killstreaks or destroy support kill streaks. So here‚Äôs what I did... i went into core free for all lobbies and there‚Äôs a lot of low levels in there running personal radars (which count towards both of those challenges) there would be games where I wasn‚Äôt destroying any at all and there would be games where I was destroying 7-8 a game. After a long dry spell of no personal radars I started asking people to put them on in the pre game lobby and 9/10 people said yes and put them on. This is the fastest way to finish up launchers.,0

CallOfDuty,brian890_,7,"[COD] Specialist for COD Cold War? Specialist are a cool feature that were added on bo3 and they have appeared in many cods even modern Warfare as a special equipment. 

The one from Modern Warfare are just a couple of special equipment and perks and to be honest they are not that good, but also they aren't as broken and unbalanced as bo4

So i was thinking that Cold War could use them, not as a character like in black ops 3 but more like a special big ass equipment for the player so check this out


-Death machine: as a special equipment, not like in bo1 having to get it from a care package


-Grim ripper: same way as the death machine, it became a special equipment, not from a care package


-Flamethrower: because the one from bo1 sucked so bad



I don't know what else could be but the grim ripper and death machine could make a great comeback from bo1 as specialist weapon",0

CallOfDuty,KaiHedgehog,8,"[COD]My COD Rankings from Black Ops too Modern Warfare 2019 Before I start, understand that this is an opinion. While I understand our lists maybe different, I don‚Äôt think insults and stuff is necessary. I will only be ranking these lists based on Multiplayer. I‚Äôll be happy to debate in a respectful manor. This list will be from Worse to best.So let‚Äôs get to it..

Advanced Warfare-
I‚Äôm not ranking this cod at this worse but it‚Äôs last because I simply never played it. I don‚Äôt feel right for me to rank something I‚Äôve never played so if you love Advance warfare, don‚Äôt take this to heart. I‚Äôve heard of the infamous Bal-27 and I‚Äôve seen some gameplay and honestly, it looks pretty fun. Though I really don‚Äôt wanna get bodied by the Obsidian steed nor do I want to fight with supply drops again, so it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôll never touch this COD. 

Modern Warfare (2019)
Now if I have to rank the worse cod I‚Äôve ever played it‚Äôs definitely the latest Modern Warfare. Once I heard the mini map was gone and it was gonna be revamp too where it doesn‚Äôt show enemy fire, this cod was doomed. The maps are the worst I‚Äôve played in the series. I‚Äôd rather play Aftermath from BO2 then Piccadilly. They ruined remastered maps that didn‚Äôt need to be touched in the first place and the SBMM. My goodness. You can tell this game was made for new players and I respect that, but sometimes you gotta get punched in the mouth so much until you learn to fight back. 

Modern Warfare Remastered
I didn‚Äôt have much playtime on this game. I got it from when it free on the PlayStation store and I had fun while I had it. I understand why people love Crash, Backlot, wet works, and the other maps the original 2007 game shipped with. Though the game made me appreciate the newer multiplayers more. The M16 is still a beast. The perk variety is meh. Frag x3. Martyrdom, juggernaut, UAV Jammer and stopping power are must runs. The kill streaks aren‚Äôt all that. Really it‚Äôs a copy and paste of the original so not much to say here. 

Ghosts
Ghosts is one of those games that I have a love hate relationship with. Sometimes I have fun on it. Other times, I just turn off my PS3 and won‚Äôt touch it for a while. Ghosts wasn‚Äôt all that to me. I don‚Äôt hate it, but it never wowed me. I heard SND was the pinnacle of what SND should be so I have respect for it for that. Infected was fun from time to time and the dlc was spot on. Hands down the best DLC in the series. One thing I have a problem with is....why did you change the UAV? Satcom wasn‚Äôt needed honestly and that change just made no sense to me. 

Infinite Warfare
I don‚Äôt get the hate that infinite warfare received. I personally had fun with it. I get it though. The community was kinda burned on on jet pack cods though most was just bandwagon hate. Infinite Warfare wasn‚Äôt a bad cod to me. It was fun to watch competitively, the maps could be fun at times and the weapon variant system was how it should‚Äôve been in AW. IW is still a cod I play to this day and I have more fun with it then MW. That says a lot honestly. 

Modern Warfare 3
The only reason why this is so high is because of the specialist strike package, and infected. Infected was so fun and getting Moabs in that game mode was the best feeling. Not to mention getting all your specialist streaks and running around feeling like a super soldier with the MP7 or the silenced ACR. I play this cod sometimes and it‚Äôs nice to go back and do both those things mentioned above. Not to mention that Hardhat and Dome are such good maps. 

World War 2
This is a tale of two games. At the beginning, World War 2 wasn‚Äôt fun. Division system wasn‚Äôt a hit. The maps were terrible (not as bad as MW 2019) the steaks were doing it for me, and getting pistol grips out of the supply drops just pissed me off even more. After the former head of Sledgehammer left, that game got a WHOLE lot better. The division system became amazing, blitzkrieg is definitely my favorite perk in the game. The weapon contracts were amazing. Specialist were also introduced into the game and though it wasn‚Äôt as good as MW3, it was still pretty fun. I think if people gave the game another chance during its life cycle, it would‚Äôve gotten more respect. Sadly, Fortnite was a monster at the time and getting off to a bad launch didn‚Äôt help its case at all. 

Black Ops 3
Black ops 3 is a Jet pack cod done right. The smooth movement, the wall running was fun, dark matter was a very fun reward to go after even though I never reached it. The maps are honestly slept on. Though it got annoying playing on combine over and over, I still had a lot of fun. The only thing keeping this game out of top 3 is definitely the black market. Weapons in supply drops just don‚Äôt do it for me at all. Not to mention that a certain dlc pack was exclusive to one console. 

Black Ops 4
I played the shit out of black ops 4. I loved it. Even when I wanted to throw my controller, I still loved it. The 150 health, while I feel like it was unnecessary, it made my gun play get better. The standard maps were pretty good, though the DLC maps were sus asf. Specialists were a little overdone. BO3 did them perfectly but BO4 just turned it to another level. I never liked specialists to begin with cause I thought it was just a way to get cheap skills. Adding zero into the game didn‚Äôt help at all. The black market‚Äôs overhaul was a must need and thanks to it, I have every weapon I want. This is also the first cod where I‚Äôve gotten all my guns diamond. I have more playtime in this game then any other cod. If only Treyarch could nerd the crossbow and VMP though..

Black Ops 1
Black ops 1 is a pinnacle of his match making should be. SBMM should not be in any call of duty pub match. Save it for competitive. This game was amazing. It has some of the most iconic maps and guns of all time. The Killstreaks put in work. Black bird chopper gunner and dogs was definitely the chain to run. The only two problems I can think of were second chance and ghost not working right. Other then that I don‚Äôt have any problems with black ops 1. I loved it but it just doesn‚Äôt come close to number one for me.

Black Ops 2
Some of the best gaming experiences I ever had. I remember coming home from school, doing my homework and jumping straight on black ops 2 with my friends. This was the cod that got me into the franchise and I haven‚Äôt looked back since. I got obliterated so many times and it pushed me to get better. I wanted to see my name at the top of the leader board. I wanted to drop 30 and get a swarm. I practiced everyday and played a lot of SND because it taught me how to stay alive and use my live to my advantage. I remember my first time getting a VSAT and a swarm. Best day of my life in the that game and yes I was one of those guys running around with a Remington shotgun. In my opinion, it was only way for to challenge the snipers. My god quickscopping was waayyyyyy out of control. Black ops 2 is definitely my favorite cod of all time and if it wasn‚Äôt hacked to shit I‚Äôd definitely still be playing it no matter what cod game is out.",0
CallOfDuty,angcalo,3,"[BO2] BO2 is a hacked mess and worse than before. The title speaks for itself. On Xbox, search for a match on any of the main modes (TDM, Dom, SND) and find a match. It‚Äôs a disaster. Aimbots, god mode, colorful tags and zombies menus. I have a clip that I might add but this guy had tomahawks that would kill through multiple walls. The next game I get teleported across the map and killed repeatedly by a clan of five ‚Äúpeople‚Äù with god mode. The next game I get into a SND lobby and a guy is aimbotting shooting through walls.

CallOfDuty,therealblitz1274,4,"[COD] Bo5 2020 Ideas and Discussion If the leaks are correct and cod 2020 is a cold war game, then I'm disappointed. I was so excited that the leaks originally told of a vietnam game using mw's newer engine. Just imagine walking through a swampy jungle to take out a local nva leader, pushing the lush foliage out of your way as you move, being careful to hold your m16a1 above the water so that your weapon doesn't jam. That would've been lit. Since that will not be the case, I want a different style campaign. It would be cool if the game was more open, a large map with a story. This would allow for more interesting gameplay and would be a first for call of duty. Would you buy a game like this? I know I would. It would be incredible if you had to organize what you were carrying, making sure that your character wasn't carrying too much, otherwise he or she would get exhausted and fatigued. Bullets should actually effect you more and when you are shot, all of your stats should be lowered until you can receive medical attention via a combat medic. In return, enemies should have a harder time hitting you, especially behind large objects. This will change the flow of the game, making it much more tactical instead of you being Rambo and taking 6 shots of 7.62 ammunition to the chest, only to one shot the npc with your 9mm pistol. These are just my thoughts though. No doubt I will be downvoted to oblivion for even considering making the campaigns slightly more difficult and tactical. Leave your thoughts in the comments please, because i would like to see what the community's thoughts are on this.",0

CallOfDuty,abalwaysballin123,1,"[BO2] bots learning from us? Curious to know if anyone knows exactly how the bots are ‚Äútrained‚Äù, hopefully this makes sense lol. 

We‚Äôve been playing bots out of boredom for a couple weeks now, we went from regular to hardened to veteran, went back to hardened because the veteran bots just weren‚Äôt trained great, they just seem like they‚Äôre cheating the whole time (I know it‚Äôs a computer.) for example, you‚Äôre looking at someone across the map with your sniper, and as soon as you get them in your sights they turn around immediately and kill you from 10 yards out with a pistol lol,
Or turning a corner and they‚Äôre staring at you shooting as you turn the corner because they know exactly where you are, res pawning and getting shot before you even move over and over again. 

So, back to the question. We‚Äôve been playing hardened for weeks now, one day we were playing it was great, we‚Äôre feeling good, the next game they‚Äôre just smashing us, and they haven‚Äôt stopped ever since. 

It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre getting really good like they‚Äôre starting to match our techniques and level, and we‚Äôve also noticed they‚Äôre starting to use our weapons too, if I‚Äôm sniping on a map, there‚Äôs 2 sniper bots, if my bfs using a SMR, 2 bots are using SMR‚Äôs. 

Are the bots learning from us? Are we teaching the bots our game play? 

Idk if this is a bizzare question or anyone can actually answer this or if this is like a programmer question, we‚Äôre just really curious to know how they got so much better over 1 game, and they pick up on our weapon choices when there‚Äôs tons of options. 

We feel like we are progressively getting better but so are they.",0

CallOfDuty,MaverickTopGun69,16,"[COD] COD 2020, Black Ops Cold War, Vietnam, whatever it may be... I hope this game is dark and eerie, similar to WaW in its own respect. I don't know about you guys, but that game is still the most creepy Call of Duty game to date. While the time period and context is completely different, I'd love it if this next game gives the same general vibe as WaW. That first cutscene was crucial to the aesthetic of the game IMO. 

MW did a great job (with their campaign) in terms of engagement, and giving you some options as to go about certain situations. And if you did something wrong, there were consequences to follow (i.e. Barkov hitting you when he tells you to go in the corner and you're looking at him, kinda scared the s*** out of me). Combine this with the storyline and objectives, this was overall a very immersive campaign. It made you feel like you were actually facing the task at hand, like Clean House, Going Dark, etc. 

If the COD 2020 uses elements of the MW campaign and implements it correctly into a Vietnam/Cold War setting, I believe that it could be a pretty dark and scary game. I'd like it to be more in line with the terrifying aura of WaW, rather than the pretty in-line BO1 campaign (RIP Bowman). 

I'd love to know your thoughts",0

CallOfDuty,Laaarsu,0,"[COD] Why doesn't some COD games let me choose my own weapons and attachments in every campaign? This really buggered me every time I play some of the campaign missions in MW2 and MW3. I find it rather infuriating that COD forces you in one specific combat role for the rest of the Campaign story. In MW2 and MW3, they always give you the role of Demolitions Expert and of course, the oh-so infamous M4 with the Holographic Sight and the \*shudder\* M203 Grenade Launcher. This actually pisses me off because I really want to explore other combat roles such as Marksman or the 60 Gunner.

Even in the remaster versions are these concepts still applied. I mean, I would rather go to combat with a gun that I would perfectly need for specific combat situation, rather than always go to battle with the M4 Holo Sight Grenadier. Maybe I would just want to lay down suppressive fire, or rather take the shot on a gunner high-up in the building.

Know any reasons why COD does this everytime? (except in BO franchise)",0

CallOfDuty,LuciferAOP,1,"[COD] What COD do you want in 2020? (poll + discussion) Discussion Alright so I was thinking about this year's COD and how Treyarch was unexpectedly put in charge of this game, replacing SHG. Right now there's not a lot of rumors about it. We don't know the setting or anything, all we know is that it'll be Treyarch's game.

I think BO1 remastered would be the perfect move for this year. Why?

Take me for example. I never played BO1 in its prime, but only heard good things about it. Some people describe it as their favorite COD of all time. So naturally I would love to experience it. A remaster sounds great for players like me, right?

Players who DID experience BO1 in its prime would most likely also love to play it again without the fear of being put into modded lobbies. And with better graphics, physics, everything? Sounds amazing to me!

Now BO5 or a BO reboot also sound good, but I really fear they just wouldn't be good enough. Treyarch haven't had much time (2 years?) to develop this game and it's most likely gonna show. So why not release the BO1 remaster (**assuming the remaster is already finished and they're just waiting for the perfect opportunity to release it**, of course) this year which would give them more time to polish BO5/BO reboot game.

Personally, I really wouldn't care if BO1 remaster is released without a new game. I couldn't care less. IW &amp; MWR both suffered when they were released at the same time because of the player base being split.

Your thoughts?

I don‚Äôt want to buy a bunch of games right away, so I‚Äôm trying to figure what would be the best game to buy. I‚Äôm between MWR and MW since it seems like BO4 is pretty unpopular and WWII doesn‚Äôt have many players anymore.

My brother said that he likes MWR better and that he plays it more often, so I‚Äôd be able to play with him more even if it‚Äôs an older game. However, I‚Äôm not sure how many people even play MWR anymore and if it‚Äôll still be popular a few months from now.

For context, my favorite COD is BO2 and my second favorite is BO1. I also liked the original COD4, so I know that I would like MWR, but I just don‚Äôt know what MW is like or if I‚Äôd like it. So if you have any comments about what MW is like, whether you think I‚Äôd like it based on the games I enjoy, etc then please let me know!

CallOfDuty,_SgtDerekFrost,2,"[MW3] It's unfair that MW2R and MW3R aren't on the new engine and won't have multiplayer Now, I understand they want to keep MW alive, but the game is fine.  I don't know about anyone else, but I find it unfair that a remastered game doesn't have the features of the original.

MW would be fine on its own, or if they're that worried, then they can release MW2R as its own separate game for the next IW CoD and I'm sure people would buy it.  I feel like the sort of ""Add-on"" aspect of these games is downplaying them, and it really isn't doing them justice, especially considering arguably the biggest part of the games was multiplayer.

Now, don't get me wrong, the game looks great.  MW2R looks great and I'm sure MW3R will look great as well.  I like that, good job Activision, you gave an old game the fresh coat of paint it needed, and made it look great, now where's everything else?

I'm sure everyone here will agree with me when I say MW2R either sold as its own separate game for that year's CoD, or sold as a full game now would be better than the current implementation.

Furthermore, we know Activision is currently developing the MP, or it's already been developed, according to leaks, they're just not adding it.  That's even worse, and to top it all off, it's not even on the new engine.  But, MW2R was supposedly completed in 2018, is what it is, now let's move on to MW3.

The fact that MW3R will not be on the new engine is more insulting than MW2R, because this game was in development right after MW2R, so the new engine may or may not have already been done by then.  Why not make MW3R on that new engine.  I'm sure everyone, old and new fans alike, would love if it was on the new engine, *with* multiplayer.  

If you don't believe me, just look at the Hardhat remake that just launched.  It looks absolutely amazing and I can safely say it's the only remake in MW that's on par, or even better in some ways, than the original.  As a long time MW3 fan, I think they definitely did MW3 justice with this one.

Now, just imagine *all* of MW3R on this new engine, with remastered maps that look just as good as the Hardhat remake.  Wouldn't you rather that over the old engine?

Don't you think as a remaster, it should be the *full* game with a new coat of paint, rather than just the campaign.  The point of these CoD remasters is to relive the past, to see your favorite games in a fresh coat of paint, an old game with modern graphics and sound design.  MW2 and 3 remastered could've been something special, and they were, but they could've been better, and that's what I'm really trying to get at here.

MW3R even moreso than MW2R, because if you look at newer Infinity Ward games, MW3 is always getting the short end of the stick, without fail.  Every time old stuff is brought to new IW games, MW3 either gets significantly less than CoD4 and MW2, or it gets nothing at all, and a remaster on the new engine would definitely do the game justice, same with MW2.

MW2R's campaign had amazing visuals, but imagine how much better it would look on the new engine, and how much better the game would be, seeing all your favorite maps and guns remastered, with brand new, top of the line, modern graphics.  The Hardhat remake just shows how much better they could be, especially with multiplayer.  Imagine all your favorite MW2 and 3 maps, all the guns, all the killstreaks, everything, remastered.  Imagine if they all looked just as amazing as the Hardhat remake, it would really be something special, even moreso than a remaster on the old engine.

Sorry if it sounds like a rant, but these are just my thoughts on both MW2R, and the upcoming MW3R",0

These guy literally get the best moments in this series and yet, they are practically just side protagonists. And worse yet? They practically suffer a lot as side protags. The Marines got nuked, The Rangers had to endure their country being overrun and invaded(don‚Äôt bring up cruel irony. This is a video game and needs no real life historical mentions unless the game wants to bring that up itself), then they got EMP‚Äôd. They safeguarded DC the best they could, but then their flight to Moscow got cancelled(Respawn IW reference), and just about everyone in Delta Force died. Like I said best moments, music, everything. Btw, this has no ‚ÄúAmerica needs to be on top‚Äù bias. The MW series gives the SAS and 141 so much focus, and yet, second fiddle for the US military with all their badassery. Thank you for your time.",0
CallOfDuty,Nathan93x,21,"[BO2] Playing black ops 2 online after theatre mods were disabled has taught me a valuable lesson A lot of people you speak to will say that black ops 2 is the best call of duty of all time, me included. And i think rightly so, it was great. I was super stoked to hear they had removed mods from the game so i could get back to what i consider the best call of duty in a long time. After playing for around 7/8 hours, I have come to the following conclusion:  


I see a lot of people moaning and saying that COD isn't what it used to be. That they haven't made a decent game since BLOPS2 or whatever.... man i have come to realise that us as a community has completely changed. It used to be all about fun. Different playstyles, different weapons, different tactics. People just wanted to have fun. I'm sad to say that this just isn't the case anymore. People don't want fun. They want to win. I see this in other games like MW, FIFA, UFC etc... The element of fun has completely gone out the window and been replaced by a incessant need to win.   


I realise this game is 8 years old therefore won't have the most diverse player base but DAMN, i can't believe im saying this... BLACK OPS 2 IS SO BORING. Yes, thats right. This game we all love and hold in such high regard is actually, well.... boring. Every lobby is just sweaty snipers. And thats it. Literally nothing else. I was hoping after a couple of days and word got out that more and more people will play leading to a few more well rounded games of multiple playstyles. But no. nearly 6k people on xbox and every lobby is the same.  


I guess what im trying to say is fun is no longer the meta, and i think that's sad. Anyone looking for that nostalgia trip with black ops 2, be prepared for a lot of disappointment because this is not what it used to be. I guess now i just have to wait with anticipation to see what COD 2020 will look like. One will not be holding his breath.",0

CallOfDuty,MaximumSandwich5,15,"[COD] Anyone else have a bad feeling about COD 2020? It's likely going to be very rushed considering the mess with Treyarch having to take over late into development and the pandemic likely slowing development even further. I despise MW19 and really want to believe we'd finally get a good cod but it's likely going to be garbage. Black Ops 4 was really, really bad. Worst cod ever imo and I feel like we're going to get a repeat in terms of quality.

I reckon Treyarch are currently the better of the 2 studios and have so much potential (same team that developed the amazing BO1 and BO2 after all) but they need more time. 

On a seperate note, anyone know why Treyarch games have worsened over the past few years? I mean I get why it has happened with IW (completely different team to those that developed the incredible MW1,2) but it baffles me how the same BO1,2 devs have produced probably the worst cod ever in BO4.",0

Please try again or visit [https://support.activision.com/mwstatus](https://support.activision.com/mwstatus) for updates.Error Code: 4QUIT TO DESKTOP00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 20 00 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 00

It has nothing to do with the router (restarted it a few times). I use a wired connection. My connection speed is as usual: 250mbit, 30mbs real download speed. I don't have any other bandwith-heavy applications running on my network.

I also did a full reinstall, didn't help. I did a dnsflush, winsock restart, checked my firewall. Nothing seems to be working.

For a game I bought for ‚Ç¨60, I expect it be working.

I'd left off at Relentless, and made it all the way up to, and am currently stuck at, (you've guessed it!) Heart of the Reich. I've managed to take out the first two 88mms, but the next two are proving to be an even bigger pain than the first two lol.

Is there a patten to taking them out that anyone has found works best? I feel like after knocking out the first two guns, the grenade spam got even worse and moving cover to cover is a total crapshoot. I managed one time to get into the little bunker underneath the statue but my dumbass forgot to grab the panzerschreck by the tank. (I'd used the plant charges method on the first two). 

Am I wrong to just jump/sprint around from various approaches trying to go cover to cover while doing a mix of hip firing spray &amp; pray and quick grenade/molotov chucking?",0

All of their COD entries have been phenomenal in many ways with the only slight outlier being Ghosts. Furthermore, their games have the strongest campaigns in COD, none of them being sub-par. I mean shit, even Ghosts‚Äô campaign was good. Not to mention, they also adapted Treyarch‚Äôs zombies into their CODs while still keeping it fun. All of their multiplayers have been generally enjoyable too, with Ghosts and Infinite Warfare as prolly their weakest‚Äîmost likely due to it being IW‚Äôs most unorthodox games. I don‚Äôt think the other studios can match what IW has done for COD. Sure Treyarch made the first two OG Black Ops, WaW and Zombies, and I guess Sledgehammer co-developed MW3, but everything else that COD is know for was built up by IW. Besides most of their faults have to do more with the publisher, and less themselves.  Now with the Modern Warfare, IW proved itself again. I mean they initially created the whole damn franchise. Need I say more?

CallOfDuty,ImJustFree,11,"[BO] Black Ops 1 Campaign Remastered possibly in the works? Here's the theory... So treyarch just released a video in celebration of black ops 1's ten year anniversary. I've noticed some weird things however. Hudsons voice, which others have pointed out, sounds different. That's because they DID do some editing to it. Here's proof. Hudson says a popular line in the anniversary video, that line being ""Viktor Reznov has been DEAD for 5 years!! All those times you thought he was with you, that was all in your MIND!!"", but he says this with the voice filter on. He didn't say it with a voice filter in the [original](https://youtu.be/E2DPq0F6qoM?t=06m59s) game. Would they go out of their way to do voice editing for an anniversary video. Mmm, yeah, quite possibly. There's more though. In the beginning of the anniversary video, the ""numbers lady"" announces these numbers in this order, **""04, 22, 21""**. Now we've been hearing this same lady ramble on about the same random jumble of numbers for the past decade so of course we don't think anything about it. Hudson then asks ""the numbers mason, what do they mean"". Now we sit here and think ""yeah, what does 04, 22, 21 mean?"". It looks like a date. ""Why this random date though?"" you might ask. Get this, the date isn't random. On 04/30/20, Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered released for everyone, so is hard to believe a Black Ops 1 Campaign Remaster almost exactly a year later? On 04/22/21?

This is all I've been able to gather so far, and understand this is only a THEORY, meaning I could be completely wrong. I am confident however that I am correct. Not only does the date make sense, but it continues their pattern that they usually do (BO, MW, BO, MW, you know, THAT pattern.) because they would be releasing a Black Ops remaster after a Modern Warfare remaster on almost the same month and day as each other only 1 year apart.

It seems around every corner of the CoD community, I see someone saying the campaigns and co-op are useless and take dev attention away from the multiplayer. They believe the multiplayer is the only thing of value. I personally believe that those two modes are just as important as the multiplayer, and I wouldn‚Äôt buy the games without them as I don‚Äôt wanna pay $60 for one mode.

CallOfDuty,HeisenbergBlueOG,18,"[COD] Sledgehammer Games should be the main studio for Call of Duty. It's a shame that they aren't spearheading 2020's COD title - SHG seems to be the most competent, the most bold, and the most creative out of all three studios.

Treyarch was at the helm for some time but they seem to have run out of ideas, as BO4 clearly demonstrated it was a downgrade from BO3 aside from Blackout.

Infinity Ward hasn't been the same since MW2.

SHG has only put out two titles - Advanced Warfare and WWII - two radically different experiences, but the studio has shown great initiative to stand out and make a name for themselves. Here are a few things to consider.

1) Graphics - Relying on an old engine, SHG was somehow able to make Advanced Warfare look as incredible as it did, especially the campaign. Story aside, some of the scenes looked straight out of a movie. Very impressive visuals that hold up even to this day.

2) Advanced Movement - This may be a bit controversial, but this was the biggest jump in gameplay mechanics that COD has ever seen and I praise them for thinking forward with the franchise and introducing a new learning curve which was fun and fresh, although Treyarch did improve on the idea with BO3.

3) Multiplayer - WWII launched with low map counts and uninspired design, but they also introduced something entirely new with War Mode - a great idea for MP gameplay which sadly wasn't implemented by the other studios. DLC maps were great and the mid-year overhaul was unprecedented which helped fix many of the design choices that were made. The map selection in Advanced Warfare was great, varied, and unique - even at launch. The game first introduced the Firing Range, then completely expanded upon that idea with HQ where they also brought us plenty of new events.

4) Loadouts - Expanding on the Pick 10 system, Advanced Warfare also allowed us to allocate points to either use or NOT use killstreaks - which also were customizable, another first for the franchise. With WWII, we were introduced to Divisions and Basic Trainings which switched up the whole loadout meta and catered to many different styles, with new ones added throughout the life cycle of the game.

5) Microtransactions - Although they were the first to introduce MTX in AW, their implementation of it in WWII is still the best we have seen to this day. They allowed to use in-game currency to work on contracts to get any weapon or weapon variant we wanted. None of this $20-30 bundle nonsense that we see nowadays.

Personally I can't wait to see what SHG has in store for us next.",0

CallOfDuty,bRandonN_93,1,"Cannot find a match on Warzone PC So basically, I am already aware of this since it happened to me about a month ago, I could not find a match on Warzone and I have done everything possible to try and sort this out, such as; clear cache, re-install the game and battlenet and even opening the internet ports.. still did not work and after 6 days without Warzone, it fixed by itself.

What happened was this - When I tried to unlink my activision account, it did not let me, in fact I was encountering this message every time I tried - Enforcement Detected - This account is currently ineligible for unlinking due to an active enforcement.. and after 4 days, the message changed to - Review Required - This account is currently ineligible for unlinking through this portal and will need to be reviewed.

Now the problem is happening again for the second time, however, this time it only gave me the second message from the ones that I mentioned above.

I cannot do anything else to solve this problem, all I have to do is wait I suppose.. there is no possible way to contact Activision, their facebook assist barely replies and they have no clue about the problem and the live chat is never working.. Activision does not have an email unfortunately, it is unbelievable how a company as big as Activision does not have a Customer Care Unit that can receive emails.

There are more Warzone players suffering from this as one can see their posts on the Activision forums, it really sucks to be banned for no reason at all, I mean my K/D is 1.7 so how can I ever be a cheater with that K/D? Activision does not even notify you that your account is being reviewed and for what reason, they don't even care at all..

CallOfDuty,Kravchynko,5,"[COD] Which 7th Gen Call of Duty has the least amount of Hackers for you? READ DESC I'd think it'd be a good idea to throw out 5 polls related to last Gen console Call of Duty.

This is the first, here are the other ones that I'll throw out

2. Which one would you recommend people to buy 

3. Which one do you get the most matches with 4 bars in.

4. Which one has the fastest time to find a match for you.

5. Which one provides the most fun for people right now?

Pre-Cod4 and Ghosts are excluded.

When all the results are gathered, I'll tally them up and rank each game by how many times it has been the top vote. 

Each poll will close after 3 days.

CallOfDuty,_Dogfood__,0,"[BO3] Is the New BO3 Update suppose to allow online features be used in Local Mode for Non-PlayStation Plus players ? Along with giving access to 2 New Maps and New Weapon Skins ? For context, In Black Ops 3 everything you gain while being online with your PlayStation Plus Account such as Weapons, Skins, Gobble Gums, Taunts, and Armour you earn through black market can only be used while you have Playstation Plus and you have internet but those things aren't able to be used while in Local Mode it will all appear classified as if you never earned them and other features get stripped too such as the fact that Gobble Gums costing 0 points at the start of each round in zombies as opposed to Local where it remains as 500 Points continuously.

I don't have PS Plus or WiFi I only use my hotspot occasionally to join in Party Chats to talk with my mates and while doing so I usually play games in Local Mode but today while booting up Black Ops 3 and playing it I had everything back despite playing in Local Mode with no PlayStation Plus. I had all my weapons my Gobble Gums, Even Weapon Camos I never even unlocked. I also got two new multiplayer maps which hit me like a brick. It is crazy and I started freaking out cause I missed these things and had fun playing the new maps. I'm curious if this is a permanant thing or once I turn off my PS4 I will lose all of it. Can someone please try to hop on Local Mode and see if the new update allows for all this or if this is simply a one time deal cause this has made my day and made me so much happier than I have ever been in a long time and I want to know if I should enjoy it much more while it lasts.",0

CallOfDuty,PickturePerfect,14,"COD Rankings with Explanations [COD] &amp;#x200B;

[COD Tier List](https://preview.redd.it/7hz56gwcu6z41.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aece90aedc77356771c9c9440cd7577be033808b)

Criteria  
These games are based on their multiplayer modes only (i.e. not campaign) taking into account public matches, gamebattles/wagers/ranked/competitive enjoyment, how fun they were to watch at a professional level, zombies/Br, and other features (such as game coloring, weapon feel, etc.).

Explanations  
S-tier:

Black Ops 2 - this was the GOAT COD. BO2 had the best of everything from fun pubs, exciting comp, and classic zombies. Starting from a pub/comp perspective BO2 gave some of the best maps that COD has ever seen from both a public match perspective: Hijacked, Carrier, Cargo, Nuketown 2025 and a competitive point of view: Standoff, Raid, Slums, Express, Plaza, Yemen. Additionally, there were so many good and satisfying guns in this game: M8, MSMC, AN-94, MP7, PDW-57, SCAR-H, SWAT, FAL, Ballista, DSR. This was also the first COD game with a decent ranking system that actually gave you something to grind for other than prestiging. There were crazy story lines in the comp scene between Fariko and Complexity with OpTic as the underdog but most beloved team. Even the small things in this game like having a theater mode, customizable emblems, and aesthetically pleasing camos were all overlooked features. This game is far and away the gold standard for CODs.

MW2 - probably everyone's most beloved COD. MW2 was the first game in the COD series with kill streak customization including the OP but amazingly fun Predator Missile, Harrier, Pave low, AC-130, Chopper Gunner, and last but not least Tactical Nuke. MW2 also had great maps: Highrise, Estate, Favela, Scrapyard, Terminal though I would argue that these maps weren't the most competitively viable. MW2 guns were also incredible ACR, UMP, SCAR, TAR-21, Vector, P90, not to mention the greatest feeling snipers of all time the Intervention and Barret .50 Cal. Overall, MW2 is pure representation of how fun COD was back in the day. However, I would argue that if this game was released today with Astro A40 Andy cracked on GameFuel and abusing one man army noob tubes that this game would have been a lot more frustrating.

BO3 - the best ""advanced movement game"". Whether you hate jetpacking or not, most people admit that BO3 was one of the best COD games of all time. Now I could have over rated this game due to the quality of COD's released around it but I still think this game had some features that bumped it into the S-tier. One of the main features for me was the skill gap that this game had. The movement mechanics of wall running, boost jumping, and g-sliding made it so that if you were of a high skill level than your opponent, you were going to get the kill 9/10 times. The guns in this game were also very good specifically the M8, VMP, Vesper, and ICR for comp. The maps suited this game pretty decently. The small features of this game were pretty awesome: making your own gun camos, emblems, having theater mode, and specialists (minus Heat Wave). The only really lame part of this game was the veto system in comp but most people that play GBs would just disable that feature.

A-tier

MW3- just a solid cod game. Overall good map design: HardHat, Arkaden, Seatown, Dome satisfying weapons: ACR, CM901, PP90M1, MP7, good prestige system. Best feature of MW3 was the inclusion of specialist/MOAB.

COD 4 - my first COD game. Revolutionary game that made COD what it is including perks, killstreaks, create a class. Good maps: Crash, Strike, Backlot, guns: M16, P90, AK74U, killstreaks etc.

BO1 - again this game reinforces my A-tier of solid COD games. Best Zombies maps of all time including everyone's favorite Kino der Toten. Solid multiplayer maps: Firing Range, OG Nuketown, Summit, Killstreaks: RC-XD, Napalm, SR-71, Chopper Gunner, Attack Dogs, and Weapons (even though everyone in comp used the Famas): Galil, Commando, AUG, AK74U. A really cool feature in this game was the COD currency system (that weren't micro-transactions). The main knocks on this game was how hard it was to snipe in this game and how dull the colors were, which is why it is at the bottom of the A-tier.

B-tier:

BO4 - this game was ""meh"". Everything is sorta just ""OK"" in this game, everything has it trade offs. Some good mechanics like the regular slide and ledge sliding, also some b.s. mechanics like shot-punching and slide-canceling. Stim was fun in pubs because you couldn't die to bad players but a bail out in comp. Maps were ""OK"" at best with most of the fun ones being remakes of previous Black Ops games. Guns were decent. Specialist were OK for the most part though you shouldn't have had an ability and a weapon. Entertaining to watch at least.

C-tier:

AW - tried to innovate at least. The game was originally developed for boots on the ground (BOTG) but since people hated that ""COD was the same every year"" they changed it to ""advanced movement"". Now, Advanced movement came with benefits like a higher skill gap but also disadvantages like not knowing if your opponent was going to be on the ground or 50 feet in the air. The maps were kind of trash because it seemed like most of them were modified from being BOTG. The guns were wonky in this game, double tapping the reload button to make the gun reload faster but emptying the clip, and the addition of weapon variants which essentially made this game pay to win because some variants significantly made the base gun better. The best part of this game was the customization you could choose: your helmet, armor, gloves, pants, boots basically everything. Overall, this game tried, but didn't execute.

Ghosts - Best comp SND game with some major flaws. The best part of this game was how it played in SND with maps like warhawk, sovereign, octane and a create-a-class system were you actually had to make tactical choices about how your perks could affect tactics. Blitz was also a decently fun substitution for CTF. The flaws: you died in 3 bullets which made connection an absolute game changer making Google Fiber Phil with his nighthawk router basically a glitch, Thermal hybrid red dot was so OP, you would dread the maps that weren't in the comp rotation think Stormfront and Stonehaven.

D-tier:

MW - warzone saved this game. This has got to be the worst comp/pub game in the COD franchise. Doors, loud footsteps with 3 seconds of dead silence, squad spawning, awful map design, no PRESTIGING, the list goes on to why this game is honestly trash. The ONLY thing that saved this game was Warzone which was got to be one of the best BRs ever made minus building that are (no exaggeration) 20 stories high. Still, the nailed the concept of the common mans BR in which you can still get high kills if you are talented but don't have to crank 90s against Tfue every lobby you get into.

WAW - everyone went back to COD 4. Bad sniping and MP40, drum mag, juggernaut. Enough said.

GARBAGE

WWII: The worst game in the franchise. Where to start... dull colors, maps that when they say ""3-lanes"" were 3 hallways with no cover or flanking routes that played as slow as molasses, divisions, camo that look like you just threw your gun in the mud, etc. Maybe the only thing good about this game was the ranking system that accurately (after it would place you in silver and had to grind your way up the ladder) gave you games based on your skill level.

IW: Maybe the game that people hated the most but at least MWR came out at the same year. I don't know a good map in this game, laser guns ricocheted walls, ""snaking"", 2 viable weapons, this game didn't even have a campaign or other multiplayer mode? At least it had GB integration other than that, absolutely horrible.",0

CallOfDuty,JTBSpartan,3,"[BO2] Questions about Plutonium client, BO2 as a whole Ever since I heard about the Plutonium client for BO2, I've been really excited to give it a try. Here's a couple of questions I have, directed towards the people who play/have played it-

1. How much ""free"" stuff comes with the game? I've heard from a few sources that you get all the Zombies DLC included and the Peacekeeper, but I don't know if that extends to customization MTX and DLC maps.
2. Since you have access to every weapon, killstreak, etc., does everyone pretty start at level 1, Master Prestige, or somewhere in the middle? I.e. how does rank progression work?
3. How does camo progression work? Does everyone basically have access to gold/diamond?
4. How strong is the anti-cheat? One reason I prefer it over Steam/console BO2 is because the anti-cheat is trash (because of all the theater mode infections).
5. On an unrelated note, did Treyarch remove Theater mode functionality completely? For reference, this recent video from Fortunate ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpDceSHiRO0&amp;t=605s)) shows that he played multiple games without hackers, and that trying to access it displayed ""Error"" on the thumbnail of every clip.",0

We decided that we wanted to do all of the easter eggs, and so far we have done two of the three we can do with just two players; however, the servers are very poor on this game. There has never been a night were we are into a game, at least past round 15, and the came just crashes for no reason at all, kicking us all the way back out to the start. For a map like Tranzit, where the easter egg is very short, it wasn't a big deal, but Origins is impossible. Every single time we get on a good run, the game just crashes with no explanation and there is nothing we can do. Anyone else experiencing this or is our internet just that bad?",0

And when I finally find a lobby, it says this: NOTICE you must be signed into Xbox LIVE to play LIVE matches. And I also checked how much people were playing and it said 0 people were playing.

But, SBMM, the way the game encourages slow paced gameplay, and camping holds this game back, and those have obviously turned plenty of people away from the game.

3ARC has a fantastic framework to build upon for cod 2020. They need to clearly communicate with fans, and not ignore what we want like IW has, (at least when it comes to SBMM, and the slow pace of the game)  and i guarantee it will have record amounts of players, and decrease the rate people leave games.

CallOfDuty,1cum,2,"[COD] Idea for killstreak customization. Idea for killstreak customization.

This is kinda out of the blue; but wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you could have fully customizable killstreaks. Like, a UAV for example, what if there were five stat bars, Time, Ping Frequency, Ping Length, Cost, and Distance from ground. 

A standard UAV would have 20/100 points in all of the categories, but in the killstreak menu you could, say, dump all 100 points in time and have a UAV that stays in the air for like 3 minutes, but only pings once every 15 seconds, is like 50m high, costs 600 points, and targets only stay pinged for 250ms. 

I think this would be so dope, and the possibilities are endless. What if there was an AC-130 that was only 100m in the air, and had no 25mm or 40mm cannons, but the 105mm one restocked every 2 seconds.

 Or the ‚ÄúManiac‚Äù from Ghosts, He had standard health, but he ran like 35 mph and had crazy commando-pro lunge.

What if there were bo1 Attack Dogs, but instead of a bunch of dogs, there were just two and they had like 1000 health each, could jump like 7 feet on the air, but only ran like 10 mph, so the player could run away, but he couldn‚Äôt turn around to kill it because it would catch up and bite him in the dick.

What about support streaks? wouldn‚Äôt it be awesome if you could dump all of your points in cost, So you could have vests that cost 1 kill, but only add like 5 health, and you could give them to your team in snd and give them false confidence and get them all killed?",0

CallOfDuty,SmokeySmalls,4,"[COD] Could we not get some of the old feel back in cod?  So I played CoD 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 on PC from the earlier days. These games were absolutely huge on PC and the competitive scene was crazy good fun. The gun play (jump shots etc) are fantastic and made for some very good plays. Unfortunately now, the game lacks any sort of serious competitive play and its a shame. CoD used to have a huge online presence and a massive community, tek9 for example having tek9 cinema for the frag videos and contests. You could say i'm looking at this with rose tinted goggles but there is no denying that the game play was incredibly fun. Battalion 1944 attempted to recapture this style of game but were unsuccessful as they are just a small company.

Just take a look at some of the frag vids from around that time

We had big names like d1ablo, phantasy, mintr, stevy much like you see in csgo now with their pros.

I know cod4 got released too and I had high hopes thinking we may get a console at least but unfortunately that too didn't do too well it was too casual.

With the release of games such as valorant promoting a huge competitive style of game play I think there is still hope for this type of game to come from Activision, not just that but it could make the company far more than these trash yearly games.

Maybe I am just ranting but what are your thoughts do you share any experience with the older cods?",0

CallOfDuty,obelizk,7,"[COD]Call of Duty is having a huge sale on Steam, I haven't played any of them. Which one(s) should I get? Yo I've played a lot of Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, and actually even though some people didn't like the complexity of Black Ops 4 Zombies, I solo'd Night Of The Dead I think it was called (with the help of Youtube tutorials and jeeze that was complex). I really loved shooting zombies, and I'd probably really like some fun multiplayer experience, I'm even open to a good story mode, but the new Modern Warfare was a bit too realistic for me to get that into, though the part of it I played was fun. What would you guys recommend as far as what to get on Steam sale? I remember playing zombies on my friend's xbox in college and it was ultra fun. Wasn't complex like the new one, not looking for something that needs really complex youtube tutorials, just looking for fun. There are different versions for Black Ops 3 also - Zombies Chronicles vs. Zombies Deluxe, I don't really get how a game from 2015 costs 100$, but it's half-off for 50$ right now - which one of these is better to grab? and what COD game(s) would you guys recommend? I haven't been following the franchise like some of you, but I'd like to check out some of the highlights. Thanks in advance",0

Spoiler they ranked Black Ops 2 as one the greatest cods of all time.  This reminded me of a video Woody made during Black Ops 2 life cycle where he said it was the best cod of all time as well.  It got hate from pretty much the entire community.  I went to find the video and it currently has a 50/50 like to dislike ratio.  This shows people don't appreciate something until its gone. Hopefully the next Treyarch COD game can replicate Black Ops 2s success.

Thought it was interesting and wanted to share. Thanks

Or would you be disappointed and not even bother or wait for reviews? 

I personally find the whole game funny because I think it had a great idea for full customization of your own character and not some siege ripoff of characters. The story was left on a hilarious cliffhanger and was very contrived. The federation was unique from Russians or Chinese in a modern time. But rourke was probably the worst villain ever easily. I can‚Äôt even remember if their was one character I cared about but I would like to see where a sequel would lead.

CallOfDuty,eagle3546,4,"[COD] Is there still online play for WW2? If so, is it still decent or should i get the most recent?  

Hello

I dont typically play COD but Ive had WW2 for a few years but dont play it. I recently won a bet with a buddy that has the most recent COD that says he needs to buy WW2 so we can play instead of me buying the most recent COD. I am wondering if there is still even online play for WW2. Also, is it worthwhile to get or is the gaming experience going to be really bad for him since its like 3 years old?

I am used to Madden which i know gets rid of online play every time a new one comes out.

While I want to enforce the bet so I dont have to get the new one, I also dont want him to absolutely waste his money and would be willing to tell him ill get the new one so he doesnt totally waste

CallOfDuty,ThirstyAndDelusional,9,"How do you feel about [GHOSTS] in 2020? Looking back, Ghosts was an obvious downstep from BO2. From the mechanics, to the maps, to the graphics. It was Infinity Ward's first game off of the MW series, it was the game that certified Treyarch as the powerhouse of COD. With that being said, the game wasn't bad and in many ways it was actually good. The multiplayer gamemodes were great, and the campaign was really interesting too. The alien's mode- clearly trying to ride off the Zombies hype that treyarch created, was also fun for a bit. At the time it got much hate but comparing it to the 4 games that followed, it reigns supreme. It's the last true COD to stand out, until last years MW. 

I'm not saying you should go play it, your time is almost undoubtedly spent elsewhere. I just think after dealing with Advanced Warfare, Infinite Warfare, BO3/BO4 and WWII maybe we can appreciate it a little more.",0

If I'm not wrong, it's a prequel for the old modern warfare trilogy, and I heard those were also pretty amazing. I have the remaster for both MW1 and MW2, but I was wondering when the MW3 remaster will be out. All I could find online was that it was indeed being made, but no ETA. Obviously I'm not asking for an exact date, but I dont really know how long it takes to remaster a game. If someone could tell me that its gonna be at least a year or something like that, then I'll just go ahead and buy the old one. But if its gonna be here in 2 months, then I'll just wait.

It was alright, because a year later my dad got Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and no games were damaged afterwards. Still whether or not I was underage I do not think vandalism is education. I also do not think free female female vandalism and male submission should be prohibited.

CallOfDuty,dvtunes,5,"[COD] Should FOG of War be in COD? Hello so I came with the question if Fog of War should be a feature in COD MW to end with campers situation.

Campers are the thing, if not all, most of the players hate most in COD. Comparing COD to BF, I remember prefering BF2, BF3 and BF4 to the COD games at the time, except MW2. And it was most of my friends choice too, because there was less campers as the buildings could be destroyed or parcial destroyed. 

 In my opinion we are not expected to go TDM and camp, if we go TDM it might be because we want action, just saying...

 Comparing to CS, regarding S&amp;D If we look at CS we see people standing still at one spot watch some door or entrance, but that's the nature of the game mode and there are less cheeky corners to camp. So it's S&amp;D, so it's expected to play like that, not rushing.

But regarding the weapons, in COD MW campers just pick a one shot gun, probably an akimbo revolver snakeshot, a shotgun .725. At CS you don't have that OP Weapon, so you have a chance to kill campers in a more fair fight. 

In my opinion, to address the problem of campers, CoD should have fog of war enabled, so you can see what your teammates see at minimap and we should be able to see almost the entire map at the minimap like CS. These would force campers to move cause if a players see them, even if they die after, their teammates would have seen where the camper is.

This feature should be out of range of the ghost and cold blooded effects, and work like LOL. I think that this feature would only be turned off for some game modes like search and Destroy or Gunfight cause it's a more tactical mode. Although they could try have it on.

Do you think FOG of War should be in game?

I heard that MW2 has some mods available for better gameplay. But I also heard that it has a lot of hackers that ruin the game. Are the hackers still on PC nowadays?

THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN

 The ERA of COD is not the same as it was 11 years ago. I was 11 years old on November 10, 2009 when the greatest game, MW2 was dropped. Some of the my greatest childhood  memories were made there, if it were trick shots or Model spamming, as well as abusing the F*ck out of that Beautiful OMA.  I could defiantly agree, it is a historical Time in COD history. With that being said, it is 2020. Eleven years have passed. It is now the pivotal part in a child‚Äôs life where CoD must f*cking slap on release. Sadly the times are different and I want to state I truly sympathize for the children that see the Era of COD today.

CallOfDuty,Shyn_48,2,"My daily routine of playing [COD] games This quarantine with all its downsides has made my days more structured so I just wanted to share with you this really fun daily routine I have:  
I wake up 9 AM and do my works till like 5 PM. And from 5 PM I hop on MW2 MP for some good old nostalgia. After some rounds of popping peoples head off with the Intervention and UMP I run BO3 and have some of that over the top COD gameplay with boost jumps and wall runs. After playing a few rounds of that it would be time for some classic BO3 zombies and after that I go on to the next game, which is BO4. Imo BO4 mp is the closest thing to BO2 in terms of gunplay and fun (Lack of some classic maps do hurt tho). It's probably 9 pm by now and that's the time for some Warzone with the bois. We play and drop some 50 bombs and after they're all gone, I boot up MW2019 MP. Have some real fun in that for an hour or two and then go back to sleep at like 1-2 am. Sad thing is my friends are not CoD Lovers like me and just play mw2019 because of warzone and maybe sometimes hop on mp to upgrade some guns and because of that I'm playing solo most of the times. Still ton of fun tho.Although it has lots of flaws, predatory monetization etc. CoD is truly my favorite franchise in the whole gaming industry and I have played way too many games and reached that conclusion.",0

I've recently been getting really invested in the WW2 era of movies and games, and since the entire CoD series is on sale on Steam, I'm interested in picking up a WW2 CoD game solely for the campaign. Out of all of them, which campaign is the best, in your opinion? Personally, this is what I'm looking for:

1. An experience that feels authentic and visceral with respect to the time period
2. A story that feels grounded and not overly flashy or cheesy
3. Varied gameplay experiences that explore more than one theater of war...
4. ...that's not World at War. Excellent game, but I've already played it.

Hello everyone so my friends and I are currently in the middle of Curse of Strahd being DMed by someone else in the group, and we have talked about doing more campaigns after this one wraps up. I've made it clear that I would love to DM the next campaign but I haven't figured out which one I want to do.

This current campaign were doing is everyone's first DnD campaign including the DM. Were a very relaxed group and were enjoying having fun. I love telling a story and just creating characters and voices for them.

So meat and potatoes time. I love Dragons (its been my thing since I was like 8 and picked up playing magic like 20 years ago lol) so I was wondering if their were any good pre-built campaigns that had dragons and good stories to tell. I can't wait to do a campaign and I feel like home brewing something might be to much to start out with. So any help or ideas are really appreciated!!!",1

However, I'm kind of... Uptight and overly self aware I guess? I have no imagination or acting abilities, and I always feel like a cringey awkward goober when I try to speak as my character in the group. No one else in the group seems to have this issue, so I almost feel like I'm being a hindrance to their immersion. I'll start to speak as my character, but I clam up pretty quickly when I feel my cheeks getting hot from embarrassment. I feel like my character has no personality beyond my own, I don't know how to be anyone but myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked some of the other players for tips on how to feel less awkward with RP, and bless their hearts I love them, but all of the advice I've gotten has basically boiled down to ""IDK just do it.""

so when i heard this i was obviously a bit sad. so i was thinking, are there any classes similar to a warlock? i've been thinking about going for a cleric since they have this deity - patron similarity, but i'm not sure since my character would easily fit into the wizard or sorcerer category.

Wondrous Item, **Very Rare**, *requires attunement by a Hunter Ranger*.

&amp;#x200B;

This magical armchair is fashioned from a grizzly bear, said to have hunted and killed entire tribes. This magic item can only be attuned to a Ranger of the Hunter Conclave. The chair has four charges, and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can speak one of the command words to cause of the following effects:

* The first command word, ""Run"", allows you to cast the ""Find Steed"" spell. When used this way, the chair awakens, instead of summoning a mount. It uses the statblock of a Polar Bear, except its creature type is Construct.
* The second command word, ""Hunt"", can be used while mounted on the Animated Chair. You can expend one charge to cast the ""Freedom of Movement"" spell on it.
* The third command word, ""Rest"" allows you to cast the ""Tiny Hut"" spell by expending two charges. It is unchanged, except the dome is created surrounding the chair. The ground of the tiny hut lined with the bear fur.

He protected his caretaker even through their sickness...until they both were just to old to go on...and eventually died. Upon their deaths Courage laid on Muriel‚Äôs grave, never leaving, always guarding them for as long as he could. He laid there for days...and weeks...until his body finally gave out. On the verge of death, Kiri-Jolith appeared from the heavens and granted him one simple offer...to serve his will and be the hand of justice in the mortal realm and he would reunite courage with his beloved Muriel upon his real death...Courage did not even hesitate...he gratefully agreed. 

He now serves the Immortal General, finding new strength and courage in the abilities blessed to him. He is...Courage...the Cowardly Gnull...

Personally I think taking some of the adventure paths and using them as a base then adding in Domain/settlement management could be interesting. Like capturing outposts in Avernus (Descent into Avernus) and using them to run sparring arenas, mines, barracks, a chop shop for infernal war machines, etc. Could be pretty cool. Or maybe setting up colonies on the Underdark (Out of the Abyss). 

I'm sure there are other cool things you could use to deviate from the standard of the Adventure Path. What are some yiu have used or seen?

NOTE: I'm aware you dont have to follow the AP to a T and that deviating is part of it, but I'm looking for some wilder deviations from the norm. Possibly with homebrew or 3rd party mechanics thrown in too.

Throughout the campaign we've maintained the idea that the world thinks they are two different people, and want to maintain that for laughs and some story.

I had the idea of making a simulacrum of Fah'ril and cast Nystul's magic aura on it.  Then it can take the role of Faith and make the double life even better.  But there's a problem.  Fah'ril has magic tattoos.

So here's the question: if you make a simulacrum of a character with tattoos, does the simulacrum get the tattoos as well?  The spell says they have no equipment, but would that include the ink?  Does it count as a scar?  Is it possible to remove them from the simulacrum after its been created?",1

Since UA is allowed, one of the players is creating a character with the [Undying Light patron](https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/02_UA_Underdark_Characters.pdf), as well as [Phoenix Sorcery.](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/26_UASorcererUA020617s.pdf) With Undying Light, it states that ""*when you cast a spell that deals radiant damage or fire damage, you add your Charisma modifier to that damage.*"" With Phoenix Sorcery, it also states that ""*Whenever you roll fire damage on your turn, the roll gains a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.*""

Would both of these benefits stack? Saying they have a +4 Char modifier, and cast Scorching Ray, would each hit be a 2d6 + 4, or a 2d6 + 8?

So me and my two friends were camping last night and decided to make a one off randomly in a previous world I've been working on. There Sir Tinius of Lancelot, a barbarian gnome with normal sized shield and sword. And a Canadian goose mount to boot named sir honkers. Bob Ross the red dragonborn fighter with a baby dragon brother at his shoulder named Bob Ross 2. Then there's me, Herold the Chicken, he's a goblin bard who got kicked out of his tribe for being really into music. Didn't help anyone escape lol. He's been taking care of his worg companion Sebas since he was a cub. Each character had accepted a bounty for some bandits at a local mine. They meet at the tavern and it wasn't too successful. They got kicked out and both sir tinius and sir honkers were knocked unconscious. Sir honkers is tied to Ross' belt and sir tinius easily fit into Sebas' saddle bag. Now they made there way to the mine. At the mine they paralyzed a guards neck the hassled the other one to join them. The one that joined was a teifling named Hiski. But we just called her new guy. To atone for her sins she decided to join us. We then waited to ambush the next two guards when the shift changed. Easily taken out. Then walking in there like we owned the place we confronted the leader. Before anywords spoken Sebas charged and ate his head whole with a critical bite. Laughing and taking there gold we walk out. But then the mines floor gives out and we fall what seems to be our death. While falling Herold starts playing a sick tune.. But just when we thought it was hopless we get stopped by something bouncy and sticky. We noticed it was spiderwebs. Freaking out Herold strokes some epic cords and freezes the web with his magical lute. It shatters and we fall further down. Thankfully Bob Ross two manages to barely hold us causing minimal damage. Though all around us we hear splats of flesh and bone. Using a light spell Herold lights the room up revealing a wave of jittering creatures in waves. Out of the wave forms a giant spider. Immediately it eats Hiski whole. Then out of rage Herold strokes another chord on his lute. Shocking the spider. Ross rushes forward and slices two critical strikes in. The second strike splits the demon in half forming two new spiders. Sebas gets kicked into a wall and Ross 2 freezes both the spiders in place. Unable to break the ice it leaves the inevitable.  Then with an earth quaking rift of his lute herold casues the spiders to completely explode in flames, the flames spurned by his hatred. Out of the pile of dead spider goo came hiski, slightly charred and bad smelling. And there ends the first session. Honestly it was a wild ride. Thank you for anyone who read it all.",1

I know you think he was underpowered but that's because you dont power game. Let me give you some numbers
The wizard at level 20 has roughly 6 mins of firepower (60 rounds) the Warlock we will only give half credit to. He has 1,440 mins of firepower 14,400 spells per day which equates to roughly 100x more damage dice throw  per day. Now lets not forget he can craft ANY magic item that he has the creation feats for. Lets assume he focuses on crafting skill items. At level 20 he has 23 ranks in bluff double it for his homemade items 46 add 10 from his charisma and finally glibness answer the spell. That gives a 86 before he tosses the dice. At this point hes changing his alignment bluffing his race for any  purpose even items think hes somethingnhes not. And still has 14,400 spells per day. Probably sees in magical darkness per devil sight, and had a 3,000' long trail of darkness everywhere he goes. Because.. why not 14,400 darkness spells a day.. 

Let me ask you what lie would you not act upon if you truly believed it?  How about Behamaut betrayed you? Or there is an invasion at the base of my celestial? Dont forget he probably has any magic item you can imagine. God forbid he scribes scrolls and has access to every spell ever cast...

DnD,Depressed_monkey3,22,"Hot take: rolling for stats is a bad idea So before you crucify me, hear me out.  


I've been both a player and a DM for a while now, so most of this comes from experience.  


I know rolling the dice is super fun, people enjoy rolling dice, it's half of what makes DnD what it is. Plus rolling for stats is a good gamble, on average you're likely to end up with better stats than regular point buy, who wouldn't gamble for that.  


All of the above I understand and agree with my issue is the with the unbalance within the party that it creates. As a player when you end up with great stats it's great fun, you're feeling super strong, but when you get the other end of the stick, not so much. 

  
For exemple: I ran a game where I had two of the players were a fighter, and a barbarian. The barbarian rolled really good stats, the fighter not so much. In combat the fighter quickly felt useless, and started questioning what was the point of even being in the game, if the barbarian did everything that he could do but better. We later changed his character and bumped up his stats, and everybody finished that campaign with a smile. 

  
But my point is, in this game you are in party, and everybody in the party wants to feel useful, but when you have lower stats than your other party members, it takes away from your ability to contribute.   
The argument to this would be, well just play a different class then, and that's true, you'll find that you are efficient in other areas, but it still leaves that little sour taste of knowing that if only your stats were better you could perform better in the game. Especially in 5e with the bounded accuracy, where a difference in stats can be the equivalent of a party member having 4 more ASIs than you.  


As a DM, it makes building your encounters more difficult, when you have John the peasant with his magnificent 10 on all stats, and with him Caesar the Magnificent that has rolled an 18 in all stats expect for wisdom. (backstabbing joke). You now have to adjust your encounters and the outcome is probably that Caesar will feel challenged a lot less often than John, and when Caesar feels challenged John will probably be lying 3ft under.

The fact is when everybody has the same starting line for stats, then you can truly build characters that are unique original and different without feeling like you were dealt a bad hand.   


I had many instances of this, even myself as player, if I rolled really good stats, some of the players were a bit blue from feeling like they were lacking behind, and the opposite as well. And it's not a case of jealousy between players, I've had this experience with many different players.   


There is also something to be said about the fact that rolling low stats forces you to take a more optimised build if you want to be functional and limits your creative freedom for character building, it's a lot harder to be a kobold barbarian if you rolled a 12 across the board, rather than a Hexblade where you only need to focus on one stat.

So I decided that in my games, players take the point buy system, and get an extra feat at level 1 no matter the race (lucky, resilient are banned). This way they all start from the same, there is no power gap between them, or at least none that is created by the stats.  


I'm curious what's your opinion on the matter.  


TL;DR: rolling for stats bad, extra feat good",1

Eventually once his father and grandfather have passed (current day) he is now looking for anyway to leave this city now that his only ties have been buried. Thats why hes joining the adventuring party in town (first session hasnt happened yet so we will see how that plays out.

DnD,TheMadKrow,10,"Bonus Rules for Nat 20 on Initiative Heya. So I‚Äôve been playing 5e for about 4 years and I thought it was a bit strange that getting a nat 20 on initiate is like the only combat related d20 roll that doesn‚Äôt give you any bonus.

My thought was when someone roles a nat 20 on initiative they get their choice of a free action (same rules as haste), bonus action, or movement on their first turn. Any rules that limit what you can do on your turn (such as casting multiple leveled spells) still apply. It gives a PC or NPC just a bit of an advantage because they rolled well but nothing overpowered like a full surprise round of their own.

And if you want a bit of balance: When someone roles a nat 1 they loose their choice of an action, bonus action, or movement for their first turn. That can be a big hindrance to some characters but it being only their first turn doesn‚Äôt mean they are useless for all of combat.

In the limited amounts of one shots I‚Äôve run recently all my players like the rules and most DMs I‚Äôve told also like the rule (some of them removing the Nat 1 portion). I thought I would share and see if others like this rule and might use it in their own games. Would love any feedback from people that use this rule.

DnD,VaibhavGuptaWho,11,"[OC] Seeking feedback on 5e homebrew Paladin subclass for evil players Hi everybody, very inexperienced DM here.  
One of my players, also inexperienced wants to play a Lawful Evil Dragonborn Paladin in 5e. His original idea was to be in constant search for his ""holy book"" from which he keeps quoting goofy scripture. It's half-jokey, half-serious, and I had to steer him into service of a God. I gave him a few choices and he opted for Tiamat since he's a dragonborn. Tiamat and Bahamut are both War domain in my campaign, so we agreed to have him &gt;!pretend to be a LG Bahamut follower while actually being a LE Tiamat follower!&lt;.  
Neither of us wanted an Oathbreaker Paladin, since it didn't quite fit with his idea, so I made this custom subclass for him. I'm looking for feedback on balance and story potential.

# Oath of the Elements

    The Oath of the Elements rejects the notion of Good and Evil, instead devoting themselves to the acquisition of power. Sometimes called Prime knights or Elemental knights, those who swear this oath are beset on a path to hunt and retrieve items, artifacts, and tomes of immense arcane or divine value, often for orders subservient to Primal Deities.
    
    If the time is right, you may find these paladins consorting with Angels, Devils, and Demons alike, gathering information and hints about their quarries. Prime knights are rare, but they can be found in any environment, just as content to rest in a frozen tundra cave as in a warm inn bed. Prime knights are quick to anger, their rage potent enough to fell even the mightiest of beasts, as they roam the lands in their everlasting quest to establish their own power and the power of their deities wherever they go.
    
    CHANNEL DIVINITY
    
    An Oath of the Elements paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the following two Channel Divinity options.
    
    CONTROL UNDEAD. As an action, the paladin targets one undead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him or her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin‚Äôs commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the paladin‚Äôs level is immune to this effect.
    
    CALMING PRESENCE. You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people for 10 minutes. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
    You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
    Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the effect ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.
    
    TACTICAL CONQUEROR
    By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you gain ground. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, if you're using 2 weapons, you can choose to make an attack with each weapon with a -3 to hit penalty. If you're using a single melee weapon, you cut their movement by half instead.
    
    SUPERNATURAL RESISTANCE
    At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
    
    LORD OF THE ELEMENTS
    At 20th level, you can assume the form of an avatar of nature. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain 2 benefits:
    
    &gt; You have resistance to Fire, Lightning, Poison, Acid, and Cold damage.
    &gt; Whenever you use Divine Smite, you can change the type of damage to one of Fire, Lightning, Poison, Acid, or Cold instead.
    
    Once you use this feature, you can‚Äôt use it again until you finish a long rest.

DnD,goddi23a,5,"Quick Question about poisons - dose and dosage So some DM ""teached"" me that I handle Positions wrong. Where as he, of course, is right. The usual business.

In the example he told me that it's absolutely wrong (!) to allow players to posion someone with more than one dose of mightnight tears.

In the example I allowed them to use three doses (each 1500g+dealers cut mind you) to posion a avesarry. But they had to deliver the tears through three diffrent drinks/foods. Since I reasoned that its hard to cover the taste/smell of such an high dosage.

In the end it was one dose in the wine, and two doses in the extra spicy oriantal curry.

So, the advesary took 27d6 posion damage at mightnight. She didn't survive (which is sad, since she was just framed... but the players did not know that)

Anyway the kind DM declared that would be stupid and against the rules to increase the dosage.

Its not RAW to change the doseage, but neither did I find any sage advice or similar. To my utter fascination he allows would allow players to split up the dosage as many times as there are dice. So in his game you could posion up to 9 creatures with 1d6.

So hes flexible with the concept ... but only in one direction? 

Be that as it may, I had follow up questions.

How to rule the increased or lowered dosage of other poisons?  
There's the question of delivery and the question of effect.

For example, an contact posion like Crawler Mucus would have, at lower concentraion, have a lower DC or woulnd work. And on the other hand, if increased, would have a higer DC and/or a longer effect duration? 

But how to rule whats the maximal concentraion of some contact posion before its just to much to do anything more?

Same question for Midnight tears, how many doses can someone ingest before the creature expirences side effects?

And the last part would be the Injury posions.  
Would two doses of Wyvern Poison be 14d6?

An arrowtip or bolt might not hold more than one doses. But a dagger? Shortsword?  
In case of the Injury posions I would rule that you can not split them up, since its already the minimum ammount needed in one dose.

DnD,UtterDisgrace,13,"New to RPGs, need story/rule advice My wife and I are trying to get our board game group to branch out to RPGs. One of them has played DnD once and thought the story or rules were too restrictive or the story too linear. The situation they described was: an NPC was abducted and they wanted to use their character's high agility or stealth modifiers or something (again, I'm new) to board the ship they were abducted to. They needed to roll an 18 so it was basically not going to happen. They felt stifled in what they could do, closer to a linear story than the choose-your-own-adventure they were expecting.

DnD,MarioAleksandar,3,"Half-Fomorians So I kind of screwed up the previous post and had to delete it. Basically these are the racial traits of my WIP Half-Fomorian race. 

Half-Fomorian Traits

Half-Fomorians share a number of traits in common with their Fomorian parents.

Evil Eye

You can use your action to emit a blast of psychic energy. When you use your psychic blast, each creature in the area of the blast must make Charisma saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your psychic blast, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.

Ability Score Increase

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

Age

Half-Fomorians' natural lifespan is around 3000 years and they reach maturity at age 20 . They often die early from injuries sustained in battle or from diseases.

Alignment

The Half-Fomorians share their monstrous parent's chaotic nature. Most are pushed to the outskirts of society, banished and disgraced, which commonly results in them being evil, but a rare few turn out good or neutral.

Size

Half-Fomorians are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 300 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.

Speed

Your malformed legs give you a base walking speed of 25 feet.

Keen Senses

You have proficiency in the¬†Perception¬†skill.

Darkvision

Accustomed to dark caves and the dim light of dingy streets, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‚Äôt discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Powerful Build

You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common, Sylvan and Giant.",1
DnD,Captain_Cupkirk,21,"How do I get a player to get familiar with his abilities? So, the problem is: I've been running a few one-shots for a group of my friends and one of them just... has no idea what he can do. I've created multiple characters together with him, went through all the abilities with him and then he just... forgets. Sometimes I really just want to hit him over the head with the Player's Handbook, because it's just so frustrating to have him play a rogue and he just... makes meelee attacks with his longsword. No sneak attacks, no using the cool bonus actions and forgetting how to roll attacks or damage after having played like 10 sessions... HOW?!

I've been telling him to read the PHB, I've made character sheets on dndbeyond with him, so he can simply CLICK on the actions to know what they do, but nope. It disrupts and slows down combat for the others players and sometimes I get the impression that he simply wants to play out a fantasy novel with him as the super special main character, who simply does what he wants and it works. I don't want to kick him out, because he's my best friend, we got into D&amp;D together, and the group is literally him, a friend since high school of both of us, his girlfriend, my brother and me.

I mean, at the very least, it should permit the caster to control the movement of the maddened creature. Otherwise, your target can just move to places where it can't attack anyone.

I guess if the point of the spell is to waste the target's actions by wasting yours as well, it's fine, but for a 2nd-level that lasts only a minute, can't upcast, and gives them a repeat save every round, it just feels a little underwhelming.",1

Here‚Äôs what I have so far (he‚Äôs also currently nameless although I have a couple ideas. If you have any suggestions for that as well feel free to leave them)

‚Äú[name] was born and raised in alodale keep. He was raised primarily by his grandfather after his mother passed during child birth and his father serves in the alodale guard. 

With his father away, [Name] mainly spends his time helping his grandfather with his work, that being the gravekeeper for alodale. Digging isn‚Äôt the most fun work but the job taught him respect of life and death alike. 

Another thing this taught him in his younger years was how to take a punch. Being a gravedigger as a kid tends to make you the target for certain teasing so [name] mainly kept to himself growing up.

As he got older, into his twenties, he grew much better at defending himself. He had to deal with more than a handful grave robbers coming into his grandfathers land and he was much too old to handle them himself. That and drunken bar fights when the job seemed to weigh heavier on certain nights.

At 26, [name] father didn‚Äôt make it home after being sent out to defend a near by village. When your the only gravekeeper in town, the responsibilities of burying your own loved ones lands on you alone. 

[name] is now 34, his grandfather recently passed away and he buried his only tie to this city along with him. It is time to leave this place. Perhaps adventure awaits.‚Äù

So yeah that‚Äôs what I got! Any suggestions, whether it‚Äôs a small detail or a major plot hook, would be much appreciated!

DnD,pyroaardvark,0,"Thoughts on the start of this dunamancy paladin subclass? Oath of the metaphysical 

Paladins of the oath of the metaphysical harness the power of potentiality to bend a situation and even physics to their will. Using dunamancy as a catalyst they are able to control the battlefield as well as alternate realities, gravity and even time itself.

Tenants of the metaphysical.

Actuality. Some things cannot be changed even through magic. 

Potentiality. There is power in all things, if one can harness this potential any obstacle can be overcome.

Alternativity. Just as every coin has two sides, every choice creates an alternate future, so weigh them carefully.

Spell list

1st lvl: magnify gravity, jump
2nd lvl: immovable object, gravitational smite (WIP)
3rd lvl: haste, pulse wave
4th lvl: gravity sinkhole, mordenkainens faithful hound
5th lvl: hold monster, stasis smite (WIP)

Channel divinity: 
When you choose this oath at 3rd level you gain the following two channel divinity options.
Vacuumous absorbtion: you can use your channel divinity to present your holy symbol and create a gravity well in the palm of one hand that you use to deflect and redirect ranged attacks, this gravity well can last for up to 1 minute (10 rounds) or until you choose to end it on your turn (no action needed). While it is up you create a 15 ft wide and 15 ft long area extending out in front of you, any ranged/spell attack that passes through this area has disadvantage, if the attack misses it gets sucked towards you and you become the target of a new attack roll, if the attack hits you take damage as normal and if it misses the spell/projectile is sucked into the center of the gravity well and is destroyed unless it is a magic item in which case it is shunted to the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 ft of you.
Expidited assault: you can use your channel divinity feature to briefly speed up time centered around yourself to unleash a flurry of attacks. As part of the attack action you can expend a use of your channel divinity to make an extra attack as part of that action.

Aura of Dunamis
At 7th level, dunamantic energy emanates from you, forming a bubble of protection. You and friendly creatures within 10 ft of you gain resistance to force damage and cannot have their age be forcefully changed.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.",1

DnD,DreadlordBedrock,1,"Feedback for very early drafts or homebrew spells? So my group is going to be playing again in a few weeks, and one of the things my DM is letting me do is make some homebrew spells my Wizard made during the downtime. I have some ideas that I'll pitch too them, but I wanna make sure their balanced. These are also super early draft, and there might also be spells that do the same thing I'm not aware of, 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much I would like some feedback on the basic ideas and maybe some suggestions for how to balance them when I pitch them to my DM next week,

&amp;#x200B;

Reflexive Bolt - Lightning Bolt but it bounces off of objects like older versions of the spell.  


Abjurer's Barrier - Similar to Leomund's Tiny Hut, but it's a reaction and lasts for maybe a minute. I'm thinking it might have hit points, enough that something really strong would break it. For spell level I'm thinking 6th to 8th?  


Lesser Disjunction - INT or CHA Save or the target is forcibly dissattuned from one magic item they have.  


Spellturn or Reflect Spell - Lets you reflect a spell back as a reaction if you succeed competing spell-casting checks, maybe at 5th level?

&amp;#x200B;

Motor Inversion - INT save or the target has disadvantage on all DEX checks and saves, as well as Attack Rolls due to their motor functions being reversed. In an old Star Wars comic or book somebody did that to somebody artificial limbs and the idea was terrifying and stuck with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Duplicate Literature - Consumes sheets of paper or parchment to make a copy of a text (shrinking the font, though it might become too small to read without a magnifying glass if you don't have enough). Can copy spell books or spell scrolls (you can't cast from them) and magical text fades after a number of days equal to your spellcasting ability score - the spells level X 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reverse Thunderstep - Thunderstep but the damage happens in the area you teleport too (the caster is unaffected). probably just one level higher than Thunderstep.

&amp;#x200B;

Dastardly Duplication - You crate an illusionary duplicate that you can cast spells from. I am awear that the trickery domain cleric has an ability like this so this one might not go forward. A cool idea but I don't wanna have spells that would steal abilities from other classes if I can avoid it I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mirror Trick - This one is the most complicated idea. Basically lets you travel through any reflective surface in to a mirror domain. This is connected to any other reflective surface, and you can exit through those. Any are you enter or exit is transient for 10 minutes. This would be 8th level i'm guessing, since you could travel around any reflective area, trap pursuers in the mirror dimension, ext. Might be a cool idea for a location though, or like magic that's some kind of high magic ritual.

&amp;#x200B;

Conveyed Casting - This spell is cast as part of casting another spell. When doing so you choose another creature that is treated as though it had cast the spell. You expend spell slots for both spells, and an unwilling creature may make an INT saving through causing you to loose both spells. The idea behind this is being able to cast shield on an ally or misty step them out of danger. Also, misty stepping somebody in to the air or off a bridge.",1

More of a ""You are dragged underwater by the tentacle, panicked and struggling. When you at last release your breath, submitting to death, you realizing -- much to your shock and horror -- you can breathe water.""

&amp;#x200B;

Hello. My name is Hubert Weyland Adams, and, Gods forgive me, I fear that I have uncovered a terrible truth. I am a professor of anthropology, with a focus on old-world religion. I have taught at Blackridge University for over seven years, now, but I fear that time has passed. I write you this letter from the cart of a horse drawn carriage, having tendered my letter of resignation not but three days ago, much to the understandable bewilderment of my employer. He does not understand, nor could I take the time to explain my circumstances to him. I cannot stay here. It‚Äôs not safe. I am being followed.

My life was not always one of furtive travel and paranoia. Indeed there was a time when I could walk through those halls without concern for my safety. It all began two months ago, on the 28th of Nightal, when my dear friend, former mentor, and now-colleague Francis Thurstwell came to me in my quarters one late night with an unmistakable glimmer in his eyes; a glimmer that only an academic could understand. He said that, while on one of his nocturnal forays into the university library, he came across a peculiar tome that had mistakenly found its way into the wrong section. The book -- which he presented from his satchel -- was unremarkable in appearance; a poorly-kept, leatherbound, and untitled thing. A journal, by the looks of it, and one previously unseen within our library, he assured me. It detailed a place -- a ruin, a place constructed by a long-since forgotten civilization --I tell you, and you alone: had I had even the slightest insight into the true nature of that book, I would have snatched it away and tossed it into the fireplace, unapologetically and without hesitation. But, ever-eager to work alongside my former teacher, I spent the next three weeks huddled in my study, planning the expedition. On the very first day of the following month, we gathered a crew of workmen and set out on a grim and fog-filled morning. 

The ruins were old, that much even our dimmest workman could surmise. The cyclopean stonework, while detailed, was crumbling to rubble in the salt-soaked caverns beneath the world‚Äôs crust. A circular piece of stonework -- not dissimilar in appearance to a sundial -- stood before us, and a great door blocked our passage; it seemed to both Francis and I to be made of stone, and yet no amount of force could damage it. Quite the opposite, in fact, for it seemed that our sturdiest shovels and pickaxes were all that chipped and cracked upon striking that smooth, featureless stone. I feared that all this preparation had been for naught, and, after a full week of fruitless work, I returned to my tent to try and see what, if anything, I had missed during my first several readings of the journal. When the book I withdrew from my satchel was not the thin leather bound journal, but a smooth, black book of noticeable volume with a sealed latch, I should have run into the night -- anything to put distance between myself and that infernal tome. But, in my ignorance, I unclasped the latch and spent all hours of the night in secluded study.

The contents of the book were identical to what they had been during my readings in Blackridge, or so I thought. Upon reaching the end of my previous session‚Äôs reading, I discovered that this new book (if it was indeed new, and not somehow placed onto my person -- I have my suspicions) had entire pages -- no, entire *chapters* \-- of previously absent information. Diagrams, symbols, intricate and vivid descriptions of antediluvian practices -- it was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever seen before in all my years of study. Most notably, however, the cover -- once featureless -- bore a strange symbol, which I dare not inscribe here, for fear of it being seen and recognized. Needless to say, this symbol is one that now haunts my waking world. Within the newly added chapters were the instructions for how to open the door and claim what was within - though the book made no mention nor gave indication of what our prize might be. Pleased at my apparent good fortune -- what a fool I was -- I laid in my bedroll until sleep overcame me.

I awoke -- or so it seemed -- in a briny cavern. The air was thick with decay, and reeked of fish and spoiled flesh. All around me lay the remains of all-manner of sea creatures -- sharks, squid, more fish than I could ever begin to count, even great whales -- in various states of destruction. Some seemed decayed, while others seemed mutilated; heads separated from torsos, offal spilled out onto the floor, blood splattered on every wall as if placed there by some madman who thought himself a painter. But there was method to the seemingly-wild splatterings. Though the blood was surely not newly applied, it ran and dripped as if it was placed a matter of minutes ago. Again, I saw that dread symbol, and -- upon gazing inquisitively at it a second time -- I heard it. A voice. And I will never forget the words it spoke.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight. You have been chosen.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything has already been written.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, perhaps, you will attempt to change your destiny?‚Äù

‚ÄúI will be watching.‚Äù

I promise upon all the saints and all the gods that I am not attempting to frighten or mislead you. I am a man of strong mind and keen intellect. I know what I saw. I know what I heard. That voice. That terrible voice. That ungodly -- no, older than the gods. Older than man and myth itself -- voice that sent tremors through the very core of my being. I awoke in a cold-sweat, and as I burst from my tent to tell Francis of my findings, I was alone. No workmen. No campsite. Francis was nowhere to be found. Nothing.

I tossed the journal onto the dial, packed up my things, and ran, though I am not proud of it. In that one, terrible moment. When my mind reached out to the space between the stars and made contact with that *thing*, everything became so much more clear. There are things in this world older than the world. Things that lie dreaming as they hunger for the waking world. Things that must be placated, and kept locked in endless sleep if our world is to survive. Whoever, or whatever spoke to me in my dreams that night gave me the briefest glimpse into the truth of reality. And so I returned to Blackridge, dejected and terrified for my safety. I could not stay. It knows where I am. Who is to say that it's wicked followers would not come to find me? To drag me back to that fell place and reveal whatever lies behind that accursed door.

I write you this, from the cart of a horse drawn carriage, as I flee as far from this place as I can. The journal -- this thrice damned journal -- sits in my satchel, for it returned to my side the very next night after I had thought it left to rot in the festering bowels of those caves. I refuse to open it. I refuse to look. It wants me to read it. I cannot stay here. It is not safe. I am being followed.

Be well.",1

I also plan to watch critical role as it is highly acclaimed and im sure I'll get a good feel for the system and mechanics by watching. 
My friends seem to prefer 5e if that matters,  i think its simpler anyway and a decent place to start anyway (correct me if i'm wrong). 
I would appreciate any guidance for a beginner in the hobby and future dungeon master.",1

DnD,Swirishlife,12,"Daddy issues Ok I need help.

I recently got a magic bag that once a day I pull something random out of it e.g. an unfinished ship in a bottle, 12 buttons, a new loin cloth...etc.

But last night I pulled a 3 or 4 day old human baby girl out of it and I have no idea what to do. We are currently on the road, heading to a team mates tribe, but it is still a few days off before we get there. My first thought was to ask the tribe to raise her, but that still gives me a few days to bond with her, which means I am less likely to want to give her up ( I will roll and with every passing day the DC will increase). 

So my question is, how do I raise a baby while adventuring? Is it even possible? Has this happened to you or anyone you play with and if so what did you/they do? Gods be damned, it‚Äôs funny as fuck, but I‚Äôm at a loss as to what to do. 

If it helps at all, I am a 6th level High Elf Artificer aged 104. I love my character and don‚Äôt want to give him up but there is no way he will abandon the girl, unless he feels that it is 100% the right thing to do.

Any and all help is appreciated

DnD,aagapovjr,8,"Fun way to use half-elf NPCs Just had an idea for my campaign I thought you guys might like.

In my game, the party is currently working to rescue a young man kidnapped from a remote swamp village by grungs. His father, an NPC I mostly improvised on the spot, is an aged, currently unmarried human man with a peg leg and a small scar on his neck. As a reward for saving his son, he promised to give the party a finely crafted, if slightly blunted, silver dagger. An Intelligence (History) roll revealed that silver weapons were used by monster hunters of old, and are currently very uncommon.

The father's character is set, and I think I notice that the players are somewhat curious about him. ""Hmm, I could use that somehow"", I think.

Idea: the monster hunter's son, when they find him, turns out to be a half-elf.

This shines some more light on his father's life. He's not just some random NPC with a simple backstory now. He was a renowned monster hunter, possibly Witcher-like, whose skill and poise gained him an elven wife. Years and years later, what happened happened and he is now here, in this backwater village, drowning his sorrows in swamp ale and trying to bury his last keepsake from the old times to get some peace and quiet at last. This somehow resonated with me and I wanted to get this idea out there - perhaps it could inspire some DMs as it inspired myself.",1

It is as follows: 

**(1)** The day passes uneventfully.  
**(2)**¬†A young aarakocra named Kleecka flies over and lands on the deck of the ship, exhausted. Nearby is a ship called *Our Fair Lady*¬†engaging in human trafficking on behalf of the Myriad.  
**(3)**¬†The ship passes through a field of debris and smoke fills the air. Soon, bodies can be seen. What happened here?¬†  
**(4)**¬†Another ship flying the Revelry ensign, the *Bloody Baron*,¬†captained by a rival of Three Earrings named Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Thatcher approaches from off the horizon.  
**(5)**¬†A storm begins to brew that, without special care in the form of a skill challenge, will swallow the ship by nightfall. This may add a day to the journey.  
**(6)**¬†The ship is set upon by a harem of siren lead by an ekhidna matron.  
**(7)**¬†Joao would like to throw a small festival tonight. Would the party like to help?  
**(8)**¬†On the horizon is a merchant ship called the *Sovereign*¬†flying under a Tal'Dorei Republic ensign. White flag flying, it appears to be dead in the water. What will the party respond?  
**(9)**¬†Atop a sandbar, the crew spots an older elf male who seems to have been marooned. Named Jarad, he claims to have drifted ashore after the tsunami and just wants aboard any ship he can work.  
**(10)**¬†Boerth and Heidi have found themselves in the mood for a brawl. Care to join?  
**(11)**¬†A party member catches Dajarkal in the act of sending a message to the Clovis Concord on the whereabouts of the *Wavechaser*.  
**(12)**¬†A thick mist lays upon the water. Though a small parting in the fog, the party spots an unmanned schooner burning ghostly blue lanterns drifting deeper into the mist.  
**(13)**¬†A small grey pseudodragon has decided to roost in the crow's nest.  
**(14)**¬†In the distance, the party spots a caravel flying the ensign of the Clovis Concord. They recognize this particular ship - the *Moonbeam*.  
**(15)**¬†A sahuagin warlock and its acolytes board the ship in the night, looking to reclaim the *Rod of Retribution*¬†for their patron.  
**(16)**¬†Heidi proposes a drinking competition. Who's in?  
**(17)**¬†The party finds an arrow jutting out of the wood frame of their porthole in the morning with a scroll tied to it. It reads *""Beware, for she comes at night.""*

DnD,SmaugInTheTardis,12,"My friends and I are trying not to team up against another player... I‚Äôd love some advice on how to handle this situation.

We‚Äôre a D&amp;D group of 7 people, 1 DM and 6 players.
The game started as a two-shot that 4/6 of us were apart of.
The DM offered to continue the campaign and after consulting us asked another 2 players to join.
This is all happening online and none of us knew each other beforehand. Since then we have all grown to be great friends and we have played 5 hour sessions every week for the last two months. We catch up via voice calls a few times a week and are even starting to DM for each other with a mingle of other people.

The hitch is this: 1 of the new players seems to be bored and annoyed the whole time. They‚Äôre always there for the sessions but honestly don‚Äôt seem to be having fun. 
They‚Äôve also passive aggressively pointed out what they think are flaws in how we‚Äôre using our characters‚Äô mechanical abilities.
We‚Äôve been a very rp-focused party from the start and the DM was very clear about that. We always push for more shenanigans and fun and have made up games for our characters to play in taverns. This player doesn‚Äôt seem to want anything to do with rp however, when we try and extend an olive branch, even asking about his shopping haul or day he just answers in a monotone and walks away. Out of character he then *always* says that his character isn‚Äôt good with people.
He‚Äôs also playing a Warforged Wizard which is why we initially let all of this go, of course he would be a bit withdrawn.
But it‚Äôs been literally 40 hours of play and he has yet to engage beyond that. In combat he also keeps arguing with the DM over his apparent unfairness regarding how fireball works, we play theatre of the mind so we all just trust in the DM, The DM deals with it really well without allowing himself to be a push-over but we all feel very uncomfortable when this happens.

So with our last session their character seem to be getting a bit into our recent combat but then as soon as our low-intelligence Paladin saw necrotic energy and on a nat20 perception saw a trapped soul causing him to call out the other wizard we were visiting, he had snide comments to make again.
We all know that necromancy isn‚Äôt evil but everyone else felt it to be reasonable that our paladin was uncomfortable except this player.

During these sessions we sometimes message each other privately if we are unsure if our character might have upset each other especially since we don‚Äôt have body language and most of us aren‚Äôt affecting our voices. So it happened that I was independently chatting to the other 4 members, all of us checking in over this player‚Äôs latest annoyance and I made a group chat so we could discuss it without talking for anybody.
Essentially we had all been ‚Äúriding it out‚Äù thinking we were the only ones affected or that we were overreacting. Now we know that all of us are uncomfortable and we don‚Äôt want to make it seem like we‚Äôre ganging up on him or trying to go behind our DMs back.

We love our DM and a few people who have been directly affected have had a chat to him. He recommended hashing it out one on one but the other just doesn‚Äôt seem to care.

*TLDR: 5/6 players have made a group chat to vent about how uncomfortable player 6 is making us and we don‚Äôt know if we should go to the DM or the player, and if we should all say something as a group or individually.

We had a bit of discourse over them taking something very seriously which was meant as a joke- our paladin was asking who would be willing to be platonically married for some extra HP as a part of the Ceremony Ritual Spell. He made clear it was a joke that he was making because he was surprised that it existed.
The other player took this to mean unconsensual and bordering on abuse.
Everyone involved apologised immediately, stating that they could see there was a line that they had crossed. All was forgiven.",1

DnD,Cjleroy1234,0,"The Paradox of Greesvaugh, Part 1 Hi there, I just wanted to share some stories of my campaign I'm currently running. (Kinda long, sorry)

(I and my friends who play are all experienced and homebrew a lot, so if anything seems OP or out of the ordinary, bare with me.)

This campaign is called ""The Paradox of Greesvaugh"" and its made in the same universe as the first campaign I ever ran. The timeframe when it comes to technology and stuff is just a bit before electricity was a big thing, so think guns and plumbing of course but no cars or anything like that.

The story begins with two players, a dwarf barbarian woman by the name of Sienna and a variant Eladrin elf warlock by the name of Evan (Nicknamed Hevan). They travel by rented cart to the large city of Rhodeston, in search of adventure and in the dwarf's case, strong liquor.

 They begin by first finding a good bar nearby, and then accepting a mission from a police officer to help an old general capture a criminal who broke into his house and stole his prized pistols and his wife's jewelry. They go to the home to accidentally wake the man up, for he was sleeping late. They follow the clues which lead them through two alleyways to a cloaked woman (Think Thieve's Guild armor with a cloak) and she asks if they have a business, which they lie about, but get away with. The pair enter an underground sewer place, with shady sorts gathered around a raised throne with a woman sitting upon it. The woman talks with the two of them until the elf says they are looking for the pistols. Upon hearing this, the woman calls out to a man named Fern, who matches the officer's and the old general's description, to bring out the pistols for these ""Potential Buyers"".

 After failing to negotiate a reasonable price, the pair state they will now leave, and the woman calls out to her left ""Kieran! would you be so kind as to escort our guests out?"" and a door opens, revealing the menacing form of a 9 ft tall werewolf, who acts completely like a human (Major homebrew allowance here, and also this is a PC) and follows them out. The pair leave to think of a plan, but unbeknownst to them, the werewolf is tailing them from the rooftops, following their scent to make sure they don't do anything stupid, like snitch.

 The pair, after spending some time in the bar (Elf was sketching, the dwarf was drinking) they went back to the police station. They were talking to the officer about the situation when they would hear a loud thud from behind them as Kieran dropped from a nearby building to confront them. They explained under the fear of mauling while the cop was just watching in brick-shitting fear, and then the unexpected happened. Kieran agreed to help them arrest Fern.

 They went back to the Thieve's Den, as I called it at the time, and Kieran went in while the other two hid outside. Kieran found fern and told him he had a job for him, and that there might be major gold in it for him. Fern, thick lockpick he is, agreed and walked into an ambush with Kieran holding him still while Evan used some handy-dandy manacles and Sierra punched him unconscious. They turn him in for the bounty, and Kieran joined the squad.

 Right after this, Kieran is found in the streets by the woman on the throne, name revealed as Murnia, Queen of Thieves. She then states ""I know what you did, but it's fine. Gold is gold, I totally understand. I'll break him out myself later, he's our third-best lockpick. Anyways, we are moving the den to Rivertown, so if you decide that you've had enough of running on your own little adventures, there is always a place in the Bunch for you. Good luck"" and then she spreads her BAT WINGS and flies off (variant feral teifling), leaving Keiran to his new team, and then head to the bar to celebrate a successful job.

I'll try to post part two when I get the time if people like this, and well I hope people like this lol. Have a good night :)",1
DnD,Achdealnert,4,"My first adventure concept (D&amp;D 5E) Can someone please give advice/critique my skeleton that I have constructed so far for my session zero/first session?

Session zero:
Focus on character creation.

Work with players to establish why and how they got to the tavern.

Have a group of bandits enter the tavern and cause some mayhem, inciting the players to join forces and work together for the first time

Have the tavern keep reward the players for defeating the bandits

Mysterious man takes interest in players prowess in fighting the bandits and offers a job for them to do.

End of session zero

Session 1:
Mysterious man tasks the players with retrieving a young girl that's being held captive in a nearby dungeon

Players travel to the dungeon (May have some sort of battle encounter with some more bandits or other creatures along the way)

Player's arrive and traverse dungeon (haven't mapped out the schematic of what the dungeon will be)

Player's find girl and take her back to the man

The man then proceeds to turn the girl into an orb of some sort

Session 1 ends

DnD,Nicholas_TW,30,"Am I unreasonable for banning Lucky? I like allowing feats in my games. They add a lot of extra character options, and can really help take a build to the next level. There's been a lot of contention between myself and some of my players, however, because I banned Lucky (and only Lucky).

&gt;You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.  
&gt;  
&gt;You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.  
&gt;  
&gt;If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.  
&gt;  
&gt;You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

My issues with Lucky are threefold:

1. **It slows down gameplay**. If a player (or, god forbid, players) has Lucky, because they have to declare using a luck point *before* knowing if the check is a success or failure, that means I have to give them adequate time to make that decision. I've played with similar mechanics (such as Force Points in Star Wars Saga Edition) and the only solution my group has been able to find which ensures a player doesn't feel scorned because the GM declared success/failure too quickly (thus cheating them out of using their ability) is to ask them after *every single roll* ""are you going to use your ability?""
2. **It's universally a great feat**. A big reason why I like allowing feats is that it helps add identity to  characters. Sure, due to the lack of number of feats, many builds end up taking the same couple of feats (most casters take War Caster, all archers take Sharpshooter, etc), but there are always some feats which are good for some builds, and some which aren't. There isn't a single class/build/character which wouldn't benefit immensely from Lucky, and I am unconvinced that (assuming players are already happy with their ability scores) most parties wouldn't double or triple up on Lucky if I didn't ban it as a result. In short, Lucky might not be the best feat for any build, but it's a *great* feat for *every* build.
3. **It feels 'too strong'**. I find this is a big point of contention, and I'm sure there are many people who are going to agree or disagree with me on it. My opinion on it, in short: you know the 'Inspiration Point' mechanic? The thing which is generally given by the GM as a reward for players and hoarded for the perfect moment? Lucky gives you the equivalent of three Inspiration Points. Every single day. I don't know if Lucky 'breaks' DnD 5e, but it feels like it comes pretty close in a lot of ways.

So, those are my opinions on Lucky. I doubt any of this is especially new, but here's the question I'm hoping you guys can answer for me: am I unreasonable for banning it? I make it very clear that I don't like the feat in my games from the beginning, and I explain my reasoning, but a lot of my players still argue the point every time it comes up.

Should I just let my players use the feat, since so many of them want to play with it, even though I dislike having it in my games?",1

The motivation of this patron could be to spread it's reach past goblins to try to return to it's previous form by gaining power through worship. Or maybe if it found its name it could return to full power. Idk. 

But some of the powers could be fun. Maybe at a lower level powers might be simpler to a nilbog. Damage reversal, manipulation. Maybe access to some extra spells like vicious Mockery or hidious laughter. A high level power that might be unbalanced bit I though it would be funny that damaging spells heal you buy healing spells damage you. 

My reasoning was that I am going to play a goblin soon, a race I have alwase wanted to play and I was going to play it arcane trickster to kinda get that nilbog feel. but then I figured, powers from a dirty, that either sounds like a cleric (trickery domain) or a warlock.

I was listening to shipwreck stories and heard about the ‚ÄúCustom of the Sea‚Äù. Basically if there are people shipwrecked and starving, they can draw sticks and whoever gets the shortest one, has to be eaten in order to allow the others to survive. 
I began wondering if DM‚Äôs have ever put PC‚Äôs in a situation where they had to do something like this. I‚Äôm not planning on doing anything like this in any campaigns, but I was just curious if people would do it and how accepted it would be.

DnD,ElboMan,4,"[5e] Way of the Contest Monk Subclas EXPLANATION: This is a subclass for the Monk themed around Fighting Games like Street Fighter, Tekken, or Smash- since these games often are played in tournament, it became ""Way of the Contest""- essentially a Monk whose monastery hosted fighting tournaments. Those who follow this way seek to perfect their fighting prowess so they can win duels.

Mechanically I focused on trying to fix the things that has made the Monk unnattractive to me in the past. Their big bag of situational tricks doesn't compensate well for their lack of HP, AC, and DPR, especially when so many of their abilities run off of Ki, which only comes back on a long rest.

Level 3: C-C-C-COMBO
Flurry of Blows now costs 0 Ki Points.
If you successfully hit 1 creature with an unarmed strike 3 or more times in one turn, you may select one effect from below for each hit beyond the second:
-Finisher: Add +10 to the damage of this hit.

-Grab: If the creature you're attacking is large or smaller it becomes grappled by you. Next turn you can use an action to throw the creature 10 feet from you, dealing your Martial Arts die.

-In the corner: cause the creature you're attacking to have disadvantage on attack rolls made at you until your next turn.

COMMENTS: This to me strikes a good balance- you're still restricted to your Martial Arts die but you get a consistent one more attack per turn. In later levels when Fighters get +1/2/3 weapons, you'll be able to compensate by dealing extra damage on the few turns you hit with 4 attacks in a row. It also maintains the Monks role as an anti-mage/archer character well, as they won't be able to access these effects consistently against high AC.

Level 6: Broken Hitbox
You may spend 2 Ki points to add your wisdom modifier to the attack rolls made for any unarmed strikes you make during your current turn.
Alternatively, you may give your unarmed strikes 5 foot reach for a minute.

COMMENTS: Spend some points to hope to proc your C-C-C-COMBO abilities, or play defensive with reach.

Level 11: EVO Moment 37
When a creature tries to attack you, as a reaction you may spend 3 kit points to gain +4 AC until the start of your next turn. If you are dealt no damage between activating this ability and your turn starting, you have advantage on your first unarmed strike made on that turn.

COMMENTS: Based on the most iconic moment in fighting game history, this is the only purely defensive ability on this subclass. 

Level 17: Ultimate Move
As a bonus action on a turn when you make no attacks you may spend 6 ki points to begin concentrating on your ultimate move.
If you hit with an unarmed strike while concentrating on your Ultimate Move you may, instead of dealing normal damage, cause the target to take 100 bludgeoning damage. This attack ignores immunities and resistances. You lose concentration following this.
If you are dealt damage while concentrating you make a concentration check, following the rules for spellcasters- if you lose concentration this way you regain 2 ki points and may not perform your Ultimate Move.

COMMENTS: At these high levels of play 100 damage may be less significant than it sounds. This is based on ""super moves"" found in many fighting games that need to be charged up before being used.",1

DnD,ItsFlipster,6,"Almost a Year Ago, My Favorite Hobby was Solidified This one is long, so buckle in. 

For the past four years or so, I‚Äôve been dabbling with roleplaying games. About a year ago, D&amp;D became my favorite hobby.

I had heard about D&amp;D around 2016 and was intrigued by it. I dug around online for whatever free versions of rules I could find. I found a lot about Pathfinder and tried that, but it was too complicated for me to understand at the time. 

None of my friends role-played, so I was basically alone in finding out about this. I eventually found the Acquisitions Incorporated shows, and was instantly hooked. 

I tried home brewing my own basic system and adventures, and would run them for any of my high school friends that were interested. Two of my best friends caught on, and we would take turns running short games for each other.

I live in the Midwest, but had become friends with a guy from Utah at a summer camp in the summer of 2016. I‚Äôll call him JP. We have stayed friends and remained in contact ever since. I told him about D&amp;D, and he joined my friends and I in playing over Discord, since we were all going to different colleges. 

JP became part of the group, and soon I viewed D&amp;D as a way for me to stay in touch with my best friends. 

About a year and a half ago, JP started running Waterdeep: Dragon Heist for our group, and we were having a great time. We were still playing last summer, when JP flew in to stay with me for about a week. Preparations were made, and we had our first-ever live session all together. It was one of the most genuinely fun experiences I have ever had with my friends. I wish we could have had a longer session.

At the end of the night, JP surprised me with my own gift set of the 5e core books, as well as the Acquisitions Incorporated book. I hadn‚Äôt owned my own set of rule books until that time. I have treasured them ever since.

That night, I realized that my favorite thing to do with my friends is play D&amp;D. The stories we tell, the laughs we have, and the friendships we build are so special to me.

I‚Äôve been saving this post until my cake day, because I first joined Reddit to be able to engage in this community, and I wanted to be able to celebrate it with you.

Thanks for reading.

In the words of Cody from Taking20: May your games be filled with awesome memories - and even better friends. 

TL;DR: Dungeons and Dragons became my favorite hobby when I realized how much it enabled me to stay in contact with my best friends and how it made us closer than we were before.",1

DnD,Jackalbat,7,"Do I have too many BBEGs? Hi, so I became the forever DM a year ago, and honestly, I love it. My players are always begging for more, and I'm very proud of the story that's unfolding, But, I feel like maybe I went too far with the BBEG's? 

So the first one I made is a man who was tortured by experiments when he was a child by a wizard who was allowed to because the country is all about ""Discover the future, at ANY means possible. As a result, he grew up and is currently trying to find a way to permanently kill magic forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second is the queen of the country they're currently living in. She's the stepmother of one of my PC's, as he's got a whole ""Bastard of the king/john snow "" story going on, and she's slowly poisoning the king (my PC's father) to try and puppet her son (PC's half brother) to become king so she can rule through him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third is a young girl, maybe 18 to 20, who's discovered she's the heir of a powerful wizard Who turned himself into a mummy. and it trying to locate his tomb, so she can release him and take over the world (Something this wizard was trying to do before he was entombed) She'll come off as nervous, and shy when the group meets her, I want them to like her, and be shocked that she's evil, you know, twist vilian stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

The fourth is a bard who found the tome of an ancient Lich named  The Puppetmaster. A Lich who was rumored to be able to enthrall all who even looked at him. This bard was able to convert the spells and rituals in the tome into songs when he sings, all who hear it must make a wisdom save, or be under his spell, PERMANENTLY  (There's a way to break it, I'm working on it being something like you have to shock the person, or maybe try and remind them of who they are, still working on the mechanics of it all.)

&amp;#x200B;

The fifth is a war between the Aboloths and Kracken. That are slowly trying to take over the elemental planes, and are killing everything in between to try and prove who's smarter/greater.  They're destroying the planes, and have almost entirely taken over the water plane. it's starting to come to the prime plane. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sixth (sort of) There's also a war going on with the werewolves, the Vampires, and the raven queen's followers. Which is just a mess, and I'm not even sure which ones are the real bad guys here's. (Storywise, I 've kind of made them all the bad guy)

&amp;#x200B;

With all these BBEG's, literally any one of them could be the main BadGuy.

My question is, Have I gone overboard? Or is it good to have so many options threatening the world? This is my first ever campaign, and I've never played even as a player before this campaign. So, any advice would be nice. :)",1

DnD,ZigsZag,4,"ALE - Adventurer's League Entries I recently have begun writing a grand campaign,  that has included multiple players (12) in a shifting party(max of 4 players at once) (A west marches style campaign) and wanted to share one rule that i've instated that i think i absolutely love, and should be a regular fixture

After playing, one player must be responsible for writing adventurer's log entries (ALE). This shouldn't have to fall on the same player who organized the party. If delegated to write an entry, your PC is considered ""busy"" and cannot attend to any business until the entry is completed. A single ALE can have input from more than one PC, but consolidate them into one entry.

I wrote both of these, but some of my player's ones have been absolutely wonderful

	**GRUNK THE STRONG'S ALE - 20/08/20**

   **GRUNK** heard of star fallen to Earth. Star Metal. \\textbf{GRUNK} Needed help from dwarves. **GRUNK** Left Tal'Bahri with puny sneaky halfling  Kip. Also old magic man Solarious. On way to Star, went to Dwarf Hole Nerroth Undor. Hired Dwarf Miners. Went to Star. Fought desert beasts. Attracted to Star for some reason. Dwarves used magic picks on star metal, and forged mighty blade for **GRUNK**. Kip and solarious have some star metal too. But they no want great sword like **GRUNK**. They looking for someone to trade with back in Tal'Bahri.

	**Kip the magnificent's ALE - 20/08/20**

A day like any other, I found myself in the city square, waiting to see what fortunes may fall into my lap as the heat of the day built. I seem lucky that way. No longer than it took me to drink my deep black coffee, a large fellow approached me. ""**GRUNK**"" he said, by way of introduction. After a brief explanation, as well as some help translating by an old friend I've travelled with before, Solarious the Wizard, I understood what Grunk needed - someone with certain skills in diplomacy to help him hire some skilled miners to extract what he called ""star metal"" - seemingly he saw a meteor fall strike the desert on his last adventure. We travelled together to the dwarves, and found a pair who were more than happy to help - with the low price of taking about 80 percent of the rock to themselves; Oh well, better than one hundred percent I suppose. It seems as though some of the creatures of the desert were strangely attracted and empowered by the meteor - perhaps this is no regular metal? Nonetheless, we dispatched them easily enough, and **GRUNK** got a sword much taller than I am (in fact, almost as tall as he is!) hand crafted by the dwarves. Now Solarious and I are looking for uses for this strang metal. Solarious seems to want to take it to the college and study it more; I'd be happy to trade it simply for a replacement of my trusty Crossbow that was destroyed on my last adventure. Perhaps that Tabaxi Ranger would be interested in a metal that empowers beasts? What was her name again? Ah, that's Right,  Summerwine.

&amp;#x200B;

ALE should include key moments, developments in the world that will impact other players, key loot that other players may be interested in, as well as general fun anecdotes. The most fun thing about campaigns is bonding over ALE.

As above, it should be a rule that every adventure should start with a CtA, contain a session, and conclude with ALE. An example is included below, but encourage your PCs to develop their own style (perhaps the Sorcerer uses a lot of allegories and metaphors, while the barbarian uses short, brutal statements of fact)

DnD,thatjewdude,2,"A quirky story about posting on here and a bit of an update. Before I begin, this is one of the best communities for this hobby and I'm glad I can share it with all 1.8 million of you. 

Months ago I asked y'all for some advice on how to deal with a player who was rolling Nat 1s with statistical improbability. Great advise was shared and feats, races, and items were suggested. But I had a bad dm moment and forgot to talk with this player about the solutions. A few weeks later the party levels up to twelve and I noticed that same player pick up the lucky feat instead of the ASI. A few more weeks and we start a new campaign. He actually is the DM this time around. We have another issue with someone rolling lots of 1s, he handles it perfectly by giving us a side quest where the new guy rolling all 1s was cursed and at the end he would be given an item to prevent all this bad luck. 

Yet I remember y'all's responses to my previous thread. One of them being to do this exact thing. After the session I asked about it. His response: ""in the week it happened to me I got on Reddit to see if there was ways around this. I came upon a thread which really discribed that session really well and thought hmm, someone's been having the same problem as me. So I saved it and refer back to it every now and again. 

Of course I had to see what he saved. As soon as I saw my username as the author I burst out laughing. I had to fess up to him and even showed that I authored it. We had a great laugh over it. 

The real reason for this post was not only to share this story but I wanted to say thank you for helping me retain a player and a friend who makes my Wednesdays better. He's a solid dude that should be praised as a hero but is often overlooked. The least I could do for him is to make him feel like a hero on the sword coast  Also buddy if you happen along on this thread as well, sorry about being a shit tier group as of late. Fuck Jeff!",1

Im writing a full length campaign trilogy so 3 books total right now im working on the first, all 3 books will cover 3 different parties pushing through a long story about the power that corrupts all set in a hand made setting complete with world maps etc. which i will write a adventures guide for to go along with the trilogy. I am currently playtesting the game with my own party as its being written part by part (which normally takes me roughly 2 weeks to write a sesh worth of info: make maps, give lore, story hooks, area beats etc.) and  i need you to help me slowly playtest this monster so i can improve it as i go along with feedback and so i can see how players handle some circumstances, also so i can bounce ideas off some dms for a wider pool of creative ideas.   


anyone who helps with this project for the long hall (so dming the entire module for book 1) il add your name to the credits of the back of the book as well as send you the full pdf copy of the book for free regardless if i charge for the completed book or not. I think this is common courtesy and not intended to be payment for the help.   


the rules for help are as follows:  


\- i will send you WIP versions of the pdf in its non competed state and you should dm it to a party whenever you want but hopefully within reason (basically id rather you not be 5-10 seshs behind all the other groups if i have more than 1 but we will keep in contact to see progress etc.)  
\- you should give me feedback on basically what happened during the sesh so i know what players may do in areas and how some puzzles or areas will be handled by groups, (as detailed as possible tbh if i can read a 20 page backstory i can read what you send me haha,)  
\- Do not send the WIP to anyone I would rather people not think its the completed version as to not sully the spirit of the work

DnD,Sacred_F0x,3,"D&amp;D Cast for Upcoming Show Hello! Let's say that their might be a show coming out in the future that revolves around D&amp;D. Let's say that I miiiight have my hand pretty deep in this show's story. Let's say I miiiiiight not have a lot of D&amp;D experience other then just reading all the lore.. And you miiiiight have a chance to give some vastly appreciated feedback

Please suggest D&amp;D races/creatures/whateverness for the following characters. Also understand I can't really go into that much depth with these characters for specific purposes. I would love to know what you guys would be really excited to see in a show when it comes to D&amp;D. Like, ""OMG the main character is a \_\_\_\_\_, gnarly! :)""

Characters:

Teenage girl, ferocious, daring, and not well mannered at all.

Older lady (like grandma old), bipolar, sweet with a little tough love to i hate everything in this world right now.

Two close (m) friends. Both are quite talkative. One has much more attitude and can be patronizing while the other has a more gentle spirit and can be a bit... dumb sometimes. Both are aimed to be quite entertaining and funny and while they never admit it, they love each other like brothers.

Another male. This guy is calm and clear-headed, and is an obvious bad#)$ when it comes to getting stuff done! Although the carry of this group, he seems to yearn for something more and tends to be quite introverted. 

Our leader of the group is also a male. He is a brilliant speaker, quite crafty, and is always the guy with a plan. He can be a solid shoulder to lean on, as he shows great empathy for everyone. He is the most mannered of the bunch will do anything to ensure the safety of his friends.

The last character is our main protagonist lead. Our protagonist will be a female, rather youthful, and exhibits a sense of wonder. She is tough, quite shrewd, and loves to laugh. 

Also, a pet mascot would be awesome. What pet do you think would fit best in this group?

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could share more with you guys! I would love to hear feedback from the community of people who play this awesome game. Thanks a lot!",1
DnD,OD1N_OW,10,"Help creating drunk inventions TLDR: What are some inventions no matter how simple or complex you think a drunk gunslinger could come up with could take multiple days or one night (full explanation below).  


After finishing a 4 year campaign my crew is starting a new one where magic is heavily policed and civilization is scarce  (think Remnant from RWBY for those fans). My character is an eleven gunslinger with an eccentric alchemist mother, stoic blacksmith father, and when drunk he takes after his mother and begins to wildly invent random things. Sometimes its a useless contraption other times its a bomb, either way he has no idea what it is come morning. 

The way we are playing it is we will roll a percentile which will determine how much work can be done in one drunk fulled stint, and then what is worked on, but again my character has no idea what it is once he sobers up.

I have some inventions but I am curious what this fantastic community can also come up with. The more eccentric, random, or deadly the better!

DnD,Pennyfarts300,25,"Starting new PCs at a lower level Tl;dr my DM starts out new characters at a lower level than the party, even if it's because their previous PC died

Hey everyone, DM and player here. I'm wondering what y'all think about starting new characters at a lower level than the rest of the party. I'm personally not keen on it, but I will give context and explain my DM's opinion for your consideration. Before I do, I want to say that my DM is like a brother from another mother so I'm not trying to trash talk or get anyone else to talk bad about him. 

Okay, the context. Before we started the campaign I made a character that seemed like they would be a lot of fun to play. She was an optimized drow (dexterity) fighter. As the campaign went on it became clear to me that the character and backstory really didn't fit in well with the plot that was unfolding, or the general theme of the campaign. She ended up not being very fun to play, so I asked my DM about retiring her and introducing a new character. He was on board and seemed excited, especially because I wanted my character's backstory to really mesh with the main theme of the campaign and tie into the party's goals (not the case with the first character). We ended up working on the new character for about 3-6 weeks before she joined the party, iirc.

A week or two before the new character was to be introduced, he let me know that she would be starting two levels lower than the rest of the party with the intent that she would catch up to them at some point. This took the wind out of my sails, and I told him I wasn't happy about it but that I would respect his decision. I was also surprised since we recently had others join the campaign and they didn't start out behind. 

His reasoning was that PCs are special and level up faster due to the circumstances under which they live, and that my new character is basically a mundane NPC until they join the party. His wife (also a wonderful person and player) later alluded to the fact that it is also because he wants to discourage players from frequently switching characters, which is something he briefly touched on before. 

As a DM who has dealt with players suddenly changing characters, I understand those feelings. However I don't think that I sprung this on him and it's my first time ever swapping a character. Personally I don't run my game like this, since I want people to enjoy the character they play even if that means suspending disbelief for a minute. It seems his rule also applies to people who die and roll up a new PC. That just seems like punishing someone for dying, but I'm biased. 

What do you all think about this?  Is this a rule you incorporate in your own games? Am I too lax with my players when they want to play a new character? I'm always trying to improve as a DM so I'm open to advice. Thanks in advance.",1

DnD,Alphonse123,4,"Need help designing a One Shot Well, things are looking up for me: I have a party to DM for now!  


The Problem? I have nothing to run! So, I've been gathering my shower thoughts and dreams and complied them into a single sentence: Pirate Ship Adventure. Goes good with the module I've got, and should make for a quick one-or-two off adventure with an explosive conclusion.  


Here's what I'be got so far.  


The Party are members of a Crew of Privateers aboard a Merchantman-turned-gunboat, The *Insertnamehere* (I don't have a name yet, thing of something fancy like *The Royal Main, The Prosperi, The Gilded Crest,* You get the picture), Captained by the wealthy merchant Bartholomew Brauer, or ""Brown Bart"", a well-meaning glory-hound who knows nothing of Sailing and learned all he knows about naval combat from a Book written for the Royal Naval Academy that's Twenty Years out of date.   


Captain Brauer sails under the banner of Arushii, a well-to-do Regional Power and head of this World's version of The Lord's Alliance, alongside it's neighbors Veraci and Zavros who are currently at war with the Holy Theocracy of Taevara  over dominion of the Colonies. The Party have been with Captain Brauer's Crew for nearly 4 months, and have been raiding the western shipping lanes for most of that time.   


Their luck, however, has been poor as of late. In the Past 3 Weeks they've laid ambush to 4 Cargo Ships, and 4 times a powerful Imperial Navy Frigate has appeared and intercepted their vessel, forcing the Captain to turn tail and run. This has earned him the unsavory nickname he now bears, as a portion of the crew thinks in matches the color of his pants after a botched raid. The Captain suspects there is foul play at work, and with the Rum Festival close at hand, he believes that there a disaster close at hand. Thus, he has tasked the Party, who are Officers aboard the Ship, to locate the mole and discover how they're relaying their position to the Imperial Navy.   


My current problems lay in planning and executing this Spy-plot. I've toyed around with the possibility of there being a Cultist of Taeva- the Enemy faction's Goddess- among the Crew, secretly practicing his faith to avoid scrutiny and punishment, with the spy being either a Halfling Rouge or a Elf Wizard- or a simple error on the Captain's part. Yes, I've toyed with they Idea that there is no spy, just the Captain's Paranoia. I also have certain members of the crew playing games- both legal and illegal- as well a drug-dealer selling *Jaja Bush*. There are a few other concepts I've got, like secret lovers and a suicidal drunk, but I don't want to clutter this segment with too many events or misleading paths, only a handful.   


If they manage to find the Spy (if there is one), they will earn the Captain's respect. If they turn in the Innocent Cultist, they will gain his favor and the crew's, but damn the boy to a torturous lashing and a slow, painful death in the Brig. If they Spy is not caught, the Ship will be sabotaged, sinking partly into the shallows and becoming stuck, helpless to the oncoming Imperial Frigate that's hunting them.   


 My main issues come with fleshing out the festival entertainment encounters, adding interesting events to satiate any potentially violent players, figuring out what happens if/when the Spy is caught, and building a mystery investigation around the Spy.  


I don't want the investigation to be too complex, nor too obvious, and there has to be a win/lose condition. As Freddie Mercury said, ""You can do whatever you want to my music- ***Just don't make it boring.***  


 I've toyed with the idea of the party fighting tribal warriors or a monster while hunting on an island to provide food for the feast, but that might waste too much time with the spy-thing.  


So, what do you folks think?",1

DnD,yttrione,7,"Thoughts on Free Counter Attacks and Aimed Attacks- homebrew combat ideas I wanted to put out two ideas to get feedback before trying them in my campaign: 1. Free counter attacks, and 2. Aimed attacks at armor weak spots. I understand that the battlemaster has aimed attack and parry and riposte, but I was thinking of making different attack options available to any combatant during combat. PCs and monsters alike.

1. Free counter attacks. (Idea to liven up combats with multiple counter attacks available to combatants.) When an attack misses the target's AC by = or &gt; 5, the target can make a free (without using a reaction) opportunity attack against the attacking creature. This would simulate a counterattack, as if the attacker woefully missed/rebounded off a shield/had it's attack defleted or parried away, or otherwise was caught off-balance and vulnerable to be struck by the target. 
(Variant: the counterattack could be made with advantage?) 
(Variant: the counter attack could only be used as a reaction and not free/unlimited uses)

2. Aimed attack. (Idea to deal with high AC monsters/PCs) Use your action to aim an attack (melee, ranged, or spell) at a vulnerable point in the target's armor, natural (scales, tough hide) or worn, such that you damage it. On a hit, the attack deals no damage, but it reduces the target's AC by -2 until it is repaired. Repairing could be done by magical means such as a mending or greater restoration spell or by physically repairing it using a smith/smith tools or similar workings. 
(Variant: Advantage. The attack is made with advantage, but all attacks against you have advantage until the end of your next turn, as you are soley focused on finding and striking the weakspot in their defense)
(Variant: Save instead of attack roll. The aimed attack forces the target to make a constitution saving throw, DC= 8 + your profifciency bonus + STR or DEX modifier (your choice). This would make it potentially easier to hit if the target has a high AC, but could backfire if they also have a high CON)
(Variant: Aimed attack at the target's arm/attacking appendage. Same as above, but the reducion is a -2 on their attack rolls to simulate wounding them, and their decreased ability to attack effectively while wounded.)
(Variant: stackable penalties? Each subsequent aimed attack has -2 to the attack roll or -2 to the save DC) but could continue to lower the target's AC by -2 with a successful hit. This would effectively make each aimed attack the same level of difficulty, so as to potentially dissuade attackers from continually aiming attacks.)

DnD,AmbedoAvenue,9,"Ideas to make 10,000 gold a month, or die trying My DM pulled me aside to do a mini-shot in the world we're campaigning.

He dropped me off outside a sprawling metropolis neither I nor my characters had ever seen before.

DnD,BloomingBrains,25,"I want to throw out the CR system and make BBEG's harder. Here's a few rule changes I'm toying with to accomplish that. I don't know about the rest of you, but lately I've been finding that players are much stronger than the enemies in this game. Using the CR system as written has led to horribly undertuned encounters both in my time as a GM and as a player. I get the feeling sometimes that a player could solo a monster that the book says should be appropriate for and entire group of that player's level. I know this because I've thrown enemy groups with a combined absurd CR 30+ rating at level 7 or 8 parties and they've been able to beat it, oftentimes even with spell slots, consumables, etc. left over. 

Even more frustrating is the fact that BBEG's just seem to melt in a few turns of combat. For example, I was running a climactic battle with a demon lord recently. The campaign book says that the players wouldn't be able to beat the demon lord at full strength at level 15, and that I should throw a severely weakened version of said demon lord at them. 

Not only did the players beat the full strength demon lord at level 12, but I souped him up with extra abilities, stats, hit points, AC, etc, as well. A couple of people didn't even need to burn their spell slots and a few others had tons of healing potions left over that they never needed to use once in the campaign. 

Stuff like this seems to happen a lot. And I certainly could have enemies using more ""optimal"" tactics, but I don't find it fun to metagame the hell out of every encounter. I like to just roleplay what seems like a realistic thing to do instead. I guess the problem could be that people I play with don't see it the same way and are using better tactics...but I also don't want to tell them they're not allowed to if that's how they get their kicks. 

I find this frustrating because it totally kills the immersion for me, whether I'm a player or a GM, when an encounter that is supposed to be challenging and epic just ends anticlimactically. I like riding the razors edge of the party maybe being killed, where decisions actually matter because making the wrong one could mean a serious chance of death. Where you actually have to use all of the resources at your disposal to survive. It makes victory feel that much more gratifying. 

So, here's what I'm thinking of:

* Give some monsters that have resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage immunity to nonmagical damage instead and resistance to magical damage. This would allow them to last longer and remain competitive with the action economy, which even with legendary actions feels inadequate when outnumbered by the players. Hell, totem barbarians can temporarily become resistant to all damage except psychic. If a level 3 character can do it, why not a demon lord?
* Give higher end monsters (like high-level demons, demon lords, angels, etc) flat resistance to elemental/spell damage types, except for maybe a few full immunities or exceptions where appropriate. (Evil monsters not having any resistance to radiant damage, for example). 
* Instead of gaining all hit points back on a long rest, players merely roll hit dice like they would do for a short rest. Short rests are only used to recover some class abilities. This makes magical healing much more important and nerfs over-resting strategies.

That's all I have for now. Let me know what you guys think, maybe someone has already designed some more ""hardcore"" house rules I'm not aware of. When I'm running games in the future I think I will definitely be skimming the campaign books and using them mainly for setting inspiration.

DnD,Robinsparky,29,"I made a build with 510ft ""melee"" range. Disclaimer: it requires some VERY generous interpretations of the rules. It requires rules as writen in some places and interpritations elsewhere. Also i think WotC said some of this doesnt work. I guess you could say its a bit of a... Stretch... Ok sorry ill stop.

First you take bugbear which gives you +5reach to all melee attacks 1 level in druid to get the cantrip thornwhip. 35ft so far, not bad.

You can then take 4 levels of sourcerer to get metamagic distant spell and the feat spell sniper, each of which doubles, for a total of (30*2*2)+5=125ft. (Im not going to put +5 inside the multiplixation because more spell range doesnt mean your arms get longer. If i did then total would be 570ft)

So far its been rules as writen (i think), but this is where the fun beguins. 3levels of ranger to get guardian soul subclass, which makes you large and then adds 5 to your reach. Im going to assume the thorn whip works the same way equipment does, and that if you get bigger then it does (without that you can only get a measly 150ft total). If you do this, your whip will get 2 times as long, and so will your arms, which will then grow into long tree like stups. Aka (125*2)+5=255ft.

Then well make use of those sourcerer levels to cast enlarge/reduce, making everything bigger. 255*2=510ft. Your now a huge bugbear who can attack anything is a 520ft radius (+10 coming from the fact you now take up a 10 by 10ft square).

In other words 
(((((((Thorn whip 30) x2 distant spell)x2 spell sniper)+5 bugbear)x2 giardian soul)+5 guardian soul)x2 enlarge)=510ft

The biggest rules related obsicle is the ""if you get bigger then thorn whip does"". Its a spell so its not actually changed by you getting bigger, but thematically it seems like it should work to me, and id allow it my campaign. Not sure anyone else would.

DnD,ZerotranceWing,25,"Would you rule that oathbreaker paladins lose their divine smite and lay on hands ability? (5E) I know paladins don't technically have to be the good guys in 5E in the strictest sense, but I argue that if a paladin goes full evil, they would lose access to some of their divine magic, specifically divine smite and lay on hands. Maybe I lack imagination, but I have trouble believing in an oathbreaker that still has a healing touch or whose smite deals radiant damage.

Personally, I wouldn't completely take away these abilities, but reflavor them as something else. Maybe an oathbreaker's smite deals necrotic damage instead, and gets bonus damage against celestials or humanoids instead. Maybe lay on hands, instead of healing a creature, physically saps their life force empowers the user. Just spitballing ideas here.

DnD,mahou_black,7,"Just a little feedback? I've found I enjoy creating adventures, but the *problem* is, I'm terrified of my group thinking that my module is uninteresting, too complicated, or just plain bad. As such, I'm trusting in the kindness of strangers to see if my latest idea sounds like something players would like to explore.  
FYI: This would defs be an 18+ game, and I'm pulling heavily from (mostly) literary sources (listed below).

The overarching story is the retrieval of three powerful, cursed artifacts - a crown, a cloak, and a mask. The artifacts themselves are the remnants of an ancient evil, and a living creature who puts on all three would undergo a transformation into the new avatar of this evil god.  
In addition to the party, several cults and other powerful individuals are after these artifacts for their own purposes, and the party may have to make allies of some truly heinous people and creatures to get through the ordeal unscathed. Namely, a city of horrific undead, an abandoned town just chock-full of cats, gates to the Far Realm, and at least one weird sex cult.  
I do not have a solid end goal in mind.  
The beginning adventure features an odd shop that shows up in the back alleys of a large city, showcasing a multitude of items both strange and mundane. Unfortunately, handling an item in just right (wrong?) way summons a creature intent on the destruction of the summoner and their allies.

A very limited list of Sources:  
*The King in Yellow* short story collection by Robert W. Chambers, H.P. Lovecraft's *Cthulhu Mythos* (including *The Terrible Old Man, The Cats of Ulthar,* and *The Silver Key* for sure), *Cabin in the Woods* (2011), a few creepypastas like *The Song and Dance Man*, and some general ideas from werewolf fiction, ghost stories, and whatever T.E.D.

DnD,templar_muse,0,"Encounters on the Road DM ideas for Party events/encounters when travelling on the road to their next destination.

Instructions: Roll 1d20

1-2:

Walking along the dirt path, two clerics of clearly differing opinions appear travelling the other direction. Their debate - is a monster a monster because they defy being tamed? - is clearly so fierce and animated that the pair don‚Äôt notice anything until they collide with the tank of the party.

Cleric quotes (based on who provides the answer):

From a wizard, a textbook answer but is there enlightenment therein?

Would the barbarian strike the cold wind that bites at his flesh?

Would the bard not say that music can soothe the savagest of beats?

If the priest would heal the sick and feed the hungry, are monsters not then those without tongue to speak or ear to hear?

Would the druid not say that to the pig, is not man a monster?

The party can provide the clerics an answer to resolve their debate, if the DM likes the answer the party is given a symbol of the monastery up ahead that will offer them a bed and board.

If they don‚Äôt provide an answer or it lacks wisdom - Donation required at the monastery.

3-4:

Walking along the dirt path, the party encounters a lone figure in a woman‚Äôs shall, faintly weeping, standing in the middle of the road, when they approach the figure, it attacks, revealing itself to be a zombie, easily dispatched. The shall is enchanted to emit the weeping sound and an investigation check will reveal the insignia of a town militia 1 mile to the west (plot hook).

5-6:

Walking along the dirt path, the party pass a legion of troops moving in the opposite direction. An officer asks the Party if there are any resting places up ahead. {Optional: Party contains Soldier Background} One of the legion knows and has served with the Soldier.

A friendly reception will get the party favourable treatment by the next town‚Äôs militia if they mention the officer‚Äôs name.

7-8:

Walking along the paved road, the Party encounter a Pedler or a group of Gypsies 

The Peddler or Gypsies can sell the Party a Magic item if they take the hint and offer him/them a holy symbol. ‚ÄúYou seem like decent folks, I might have something, it‚Äôs not cheap but you‚Äôll have far more use of it than I.‚Äù Removing a false panel in the cart/wagon he offers to sell the Party a potent item.

9-10:

Walking along the path, the Party encounters the camp ground for a legion that must have just passed, the campfires are still smouldering. If the Party chooses to search the campground they find several components of adventuring kits but no bodies and no treasure (with the exception of a very high DC perception check to find a gold band trampled in the mud), the campsite is simply a stopping point. If the Party stay in the campground for a long or short rest, a woman comes running out of the bush, looking for her father in the legion (plot hook).

11:

Walking along the path, a successful perception check will reveal markings etched on boulders and tree trunks that are in Thieves cant - there is a concealed underground respite 1 mile west.

12:

Walking along the path, a successful perception check will reveal markings etched on boulders and tree trunks that are in Thieves cant - there is a concealed tunnel shortcut 3 miles east.

13:

Walking along the path, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will spot a series of markings in Druidic explaining that the local forest is populated by giant spiders, shambling mounds, etc (Local monster info).

14:

Walking along the path, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will spot a series of markings in Druidic explaining that there is a goatherd shortcut path marked in Druidic up ahead.

15:

Walking along the path, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal markings etched on boulders and tree trunks that are in Thieves cant and Druidic indicating the path to a local forest encampment. The Party arrives in time to participate in an archery tournament.

16:

Walking along the path, a successful Druidic check will spot a series of markings explaining that there is a network of yew trees in the forest that permits travel via Tree Stride to 4 local towns and a druid grove 9 miles away. The grove will provide Tree Stride bracelets that only function within this forest (and only for 1 season) to non-druids upon a friendly reception.

17:

Walking along the path, the party will encounter a pillar of natural stone by the side of the road, inscribed with Druidic outlining useful information like a shortcut, nearby freshwater, berry bushes, local monsters, a treehouse resting place, etc.

18:

Walking along the path, a successful Druidic check will reveal markings etched on tree trunks that explain that there is a solstice festival being held in the glade 2 miles away (plot hook).

19:

Walking along the path, a successful Druidic check will reveal markings etched on a boulder that detail the location of a stash of dried fruit and salted meat rations and 2 wineskins of mead - stating that the weary traveller is welcome to them and a general Druidic instruction to ‚Äòpay it forward‚Äô.

DnD,CereusBlue,4,"How do you play Mute/Deaf/Blind characters well? Hello again, DnD reddit!

For some context, this will be my second time DMing (I've done some small stuff previously but this will be my first full campaign). 

In my upcoming campaign, I have a triad of characters that my players will be encountering that are, in order, Blind, Deaf, and Mute. Being that I am not any of the three, I'm a little nervous about portraying these characters well. I would like to do them justice as well as give a good example to one of my players who will be playing a mute bard in the campaign after mine is completed. 

If anyone on this subreddit is one of these three, do you have any advice on how I could portray these characters well? Or does anyone have references to be able to do them justice? I don't want their blindness, deafness, and mute(ness?) To be the focal point of their character, but still give them something to make them special. 

As a bonus if anyone is interested, I'll list them below with their special abilities coupled with how their trait is treated. If anyone has any critiques they would be so kind as to part with, I will gladly listen! One of them is still in development, I'm just having some trouble figuring her out.

Some minor backstory, there are 12 special characters that my group will be encountering. Each of them has a unique ability obtained under strange circumstances but these abilities can make each of them devastating foes. The group is in a pocket dimension held up by a self proclaimed god in his game, each of the 12 character cherry picked for their roles. 

Pardon, I'm still working out their names so only one has a name BUT! Here they are on a basic level. 

Aestris/Wood Elf/Lawful-Neutral/Blind Ranger: She has an enchanted bow that allows her arrows to always catch their mark as long as nothing obscures the target and she knows which direction they're in. She has a seeing-eye hawk/Raven (I have not decided yet). This awesome power is counteracted by the fact that she is placed in a forest.

Dwarf/Lawful-Good/Deaf Paladin: She feels danger coming. Gifted with the power of foresight, she is often recklessly good in the name of justice while still sticking to solid morals. If she can see just a few moments ahead enough, she feels she can take on any foe that dares stand in her path. She's found in a mansion. She also has a flying squirrel companion.

Firbolg/Lawful-Good/Mute Druid: This character I've had some trouble finding a good special for. She's very gentle and kind, and has a hummingbird companion. The only thing I've worked out is that she carries a staff and communes with plant life through touch. 


That's all I have for now, I appreciate all of you who have read this far, thank you again! I hope to do my best for the sake of my players as well as for the community!",1

[1700cp, 1100sp, 60gp, 8 gems, Dust of Disappearance, Potion of Resistance-Necrotic, with 18pp and 7 gold on the side.](https://preview.redd.it/2og4mimmpd151.jpg?width=1645&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb4d0ac9b2d6080f5ac099b96c764f1e7af5c95)

  
So, I was thinking about treasure hoards. As a DM, I am often guilty of just telling the party how much a treasure hoard is worth in gold. This is partially because it's assumed that they party will sell any art objects and gems when they reach town, also partially due to the fact that I don't want to party treasure keeper to ask me how much the thing he wrote as ""goblet"" is worth weeks after they found it.  
As a player, I also normally prefer this as well. It's easier to divy-up 60 gold, than thousands of copper and silver. But even so, I do realize there are a few reasons to make treasure hoards as verbose as you roll them.  
1: It's more interesting. Getting some gems, and art objects. You may end up with a player wanting to keep the copper chalice with silver filigree, or the gems stones, to trade in less civilized parts of the world. Some times gems can be used as magical components. A little flavor goes a long way.  
2: It adds a challenge to characters, especially before they have a bag of holding or haversack. Finding a large hoard of copper coins, like above, would weigh over 50 lbs. If those were just loose on the floor, the party would need to carry them. Sacks and backpacks carry 30 lbs each. Did the party take sacks with them? Are they gonna empty out two backpacks to carry all the coins? This isn't my style of gaming, but I could see some DM delighting in it.  
Well, I was thinking about playing in a virtual environment, what with times being as they are, and how fun it would be to give the party virtual treasure hoards. Wouldn't it be fun to have the DM dump out a treasure hoard on the table for everyone to divide? So I loaded up Table Top Simulator, and downloaded some resources from the workshop, and No... No it wouldn't. It would be a laggy mess. Nice to look at though. I still think it would be fun to give the players consumables, and such, so they remember to use them.  
Oh, and speaking of bags of holding, remember it takes an action to retrieve an item from the bag. If the coins were put in there loose, it would take a party of four over an hour and a half to take out all the coins. Unless they turn the bag inside out... But if they have something in there that they don't want people to see... like if they are hiding the body of an assassinated noble in there... But who would ever do that?",1

Do you guys think is It worth triyng to avoid bad consequences for adventures or campaigns?Because if the DM is the ""god"" of the world,is It worth giving him more job than he already has? Isn't better just to go with the flow and be done With it? After all,It's not a endless video game,you have a person creating this environment for you,and it depends on his will to continue to create,so delaying the main quest It's essentialy wasting his time,and he many just say (like I did for different reasons) ""Fuck it,the game is over"".

I Say that but I cannot stop thinking about how things could be different if we made a decision that made sense for the moment but It was  bad for the campaign as a whole. Like  continue to fall into a trap in a premade campaign even though you knew what was going on[.](https://happening.My)My character at the time had a 14 in INt and 16 in WIS,so avoiding the trap made sense for the character,but It would make things harder for the Dm(His first campaign).So maybe just playing a low WIS or INT charcater Its better than plaiyng a rogue,wizard or cleric that try to avoid the traps is wasting time,because you're forcing the DM to improvise,and I learned from experience that that  usually [doesn't end well for both the Dm and players.](https://bad.My) group thinks that anything that makes de Dm life's easier is better than the rest.

But what about the history?Isn't that the second most important rule for RPG after having fun?Make sense in the history,avoid to metagame and think like your character would think?Maybe the exact opposite is truth,maybe just being your characters and making decisions they would make is the principle of RPG,and triyng to avoid bad consequences is perfectly normal and reasonable.

What do you think? maybe theres a balance that I didn't see and that's actually better than either,or I'm overthinkig and should just do what makes sense In the occasion.",1

DnD,Aspynisnotatree,9,"My player is out of control. My party is not a particularly game-focused one; we love to roleplay and messing around just to be funny. I'm pretty okay with this. Most of my players are totally down if I want to do something a little more serious, though. Currently, we're going through a modified version of icespire peak, designed to be more rp based and fun for us as we don't take things all that seriously. I figured that for once I would do something at least a little shocking and serious. So, a player and I conspired together to create an intricate story of betrayal. It's a cool concept involving a ton of homebrew I did all by myself. 

Now, it's important to note that out of all my 5 players, one is particularly chaotic. She gets the party off-track quite a lot which is annoying but understandable and I typically let this slide. She also has a knack for figuring out the absolute stupidest ways of doing things and then rolling high and succeeding at them. Again, annoying, but very funny most of the time. By far what frustrates me the most is her characters, though. Her first character was unremarkable, just annoying in attitude. This second one, however, was a mild form of a nightmare. She was overpowered, as this player had a lot of high rolls for the stats (Lesson learned; make them all use point-buy system next time) and generally extremely unpredictable. She had no real backstory to speak of and her motivations were extremely unclear. I let it slide, figuring the player just never bothered to create those things. As it turns out, she actually did. The character was designed from the very beginning to be a town-of-Salem jester style character, whose main mission was to cause chaos, annoy the heck out of everyone, and eventually die. 

A brilliant character, to be sure, I'm pretty proud. But holy cow do I wish my player had told me all of this so that I could make use of it. Instead, she just stood back and laughed as the character whom she had bullied the entire time murdered her. I really do appreciate this player, she's absolutely hilarious and makes the game a lot of fun. But I would love it if for once she would take anything even slightly seriously.

I wanna DM for them in particular because I know some of these kids have been through A LOT (2 of them (my little brothers) have had a very abusive childhood, have had their father go to jail, mother attempt suicide, etc.,; 2 of the other kids' father had an aneurysm that had made him bedridden and significantly changed his personality, their family is not doing financially well at all, etc.). 

They are all however very sweet and creative kids, I think DnD would be a good outlet for them. I mentioned that I play DnD and how it kinda works to some of them, and they were ridiculously excited about the idea of playing.

I play DnD, but I'm still relatively new to it all. I've played a bunch of sessions (with Pathfinder) with some friends off and on once a week for, cumulatively, a year. I got a ton of help from some friends in making my character, and they help me with playing.

**INVOKE WINTER** 

Level 3 evocation

Casting time: 1 action.

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a water blister that once found snow)

Duration: instant

A freezing storm sweeps in from you, whipping everyone it touches. A 10-foot radius sphere centered on you moves up to 20 feet in a straight line in the direction you choose, all creatures within the area touched by the sphere, except you, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 2d6 of bludgeoning damage and 3d6 cold damage and see his speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn; or half the damage on a hit and its speed is not reduced.

Exposed flames within the spell area are extinguished, and magic fire is suppressed until the start of your next turn.

At higher levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot level 4 or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 cold or bludgeoning, you choose, for each level above 3.

[Mundane Map](https://i.imgur.com/WWoMWXm.jpg)

[High Level Detail Map](https://i.imgur.com/6QyROsV.jpg)

I‚Äôm looking to try my hand at commissions, particularly with maps. You can see an example of the look I can provide in the images above. ***The art style was heavily inspired by the maps from The Lord of the Rings.***

So if you would like to spice up your D&amp;D sessions with some maps like these, message me and we can arrange something! Since I‚Äôm testing the water of commissions, I will only take on a few commissions at a time.

**All maps are in digital PNG format only. I will currently not accept commissions for city maps, dungeon maps, or otherwise super intricate maps. I'm willing to do small scale overworld maps up to large scale overworld maps. By default map sizes are around 3000 x 3000 px at 350 dpi, but you can request a specific resolution.**

A map of a whole world might incur a larger fee than listed, depending on the overall complexity and/or size of the map required.

# Rates

* A **Mundane Map** will cost **$25 USD**. This is a basic, bare bones map that will feature an aged paper background, water, icons for towns and cities, roads, compass, it gets the job done.

* A **High Level Detail Map** will cost **$50 USD**. This, in addition to the previously mentioned features, can include shading on mountain ranges, decorative monsters, lines surrounding the coasts, and other finer details. It takes me a good chunk of time more to add these extra details but it looks sweet. If you would like the colors to be more solid than the watercolor I'm using, let me know!

* **Prices are non-negotiable!**

**I will only accept payments via PayPal invoice. PayPal information must be provided once an agreement has been made and the map completed.**

# Process 

PM me and let me know that you‚Äôd like a commission with what kind of map details you want, what resolution you‚Äôre seeking, and provide me with a rough draft or a sketch of the map if available since that will help me out. Or at the very least, a vivid text description of what you're looking for.

I could provide status updates by sending lower resolution &amp; watermarked versions of the map. If you have a certain color you want for your water, trees, lava, etc let me know! Also, color codes really help pin down exact colors.

Once the commission is completed, I will send you a PayPal invoice with the map fee. Upon confirmation of payment, you will receive the full resolution image free of watermarks via e-mail.

# Refund policy

**Once payment has been received, payment is non-refundable.**

# Usage Rights 

Images you commission are free for you to use in any noncommercial setting/reproduce for personal use. I do require that you credit me.

**All maps are in digital PNG format only. I will currently not accept commissions for city maps, dungeon maps, or otherwise super intricate maps.**

# Styles of Environment 

# Examples 

If you are interested in a commission, simply state which style of trees, water, mountains, etc. you would like on your map.

If you have questions about this, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask!

# [Trees](https://i.imgur.com/69HAQb9.png)

Tree style A is good for large forests, Style B can also be used for large forests or groves or meadows, and Style C would be best if this is a smaller scale map since it helps provide detail.

# [Mountains](https://i.imgur.com/rOqg7WD.png) 

##Available with no shading (top row), smooth shading (middle row), and rough shading (bottom row).

# [Rivers](https://i.imgur.com/TiPdRjc.png)

# [Coast and Islands](https://i.imgur.com/aIvHftc.png)

Style A would be Mundane while Style B can be considered high level detail due to the amount of time it takes to evenly space out the lines and maintain their shape.

# [Lakes](https://i.imgur.com/fVm8wzp.png)

Style A would be considered mundane, Styles B and C could be considered mundane as well if there aren't a lot of lakes in the map. Otherwise you can only get that with a high level detail map.

## For example, the Map of Anasazi at the start of the post uses B style trees, C style mountains with rough shading, B style rivers, B style coasts and islands, and B style lakes. The more complex the design, the longer it will take me to complete the map. **This would be considered a High-Level Detail map.**

**So if you want a map, send me a PM and let‚Äôs get started!**",1

DnD,spork154,6,"Taking a character Hi all, I'm pretty new to d&amp;d but I've had an idea for a campaign I want to run but I'm not experienced enough to know whether it can be done. I want to do a cultist story which would involve the players at some point to be taken hostage, and one of them, roll permitted, to be taken as an acolyte. The player would still play but would not be travelling with the party and instead be attacking his team when any encounters occur. Is this doable? Is it recommended? I realize I'd be taking agency from the player for a little while but in the campaign I had planned he would be able to either escape and give info to his/her party or stay under the cultists control until the ones responsible were dead. Looking for advice and tips too as this will be my first big campaign and I want to make it memorable!",1
DnD,Tetsujin87,4,"Norse mythology monster menagerie++ (including skills &amp; spells) Hey, I'm just scribbling some interesting ideas for dnd monsters mostly inspired by norse mythology.

The monsters have no stats, so feel free to add your own. Also, a lot of the skills and spells lack stats (dc, range etc.), so feel free to fill in here as well. Though some parameters for the skills and spells are quite intuitive, and easy to guess.

I especially like the ""Depressed"" state from ""Wind of Doubt"" and ""White Rage"" from the Glass Dragon.

Here's the dump:

Gullinbursti (Giant Gold Mechanical Boar):
Immune to poison, necrotic dmg. Immune to all biological illnesses. Resistant against all elements except fire (deal 2x dmg). Absorbs all electric dmg, discharges back on next physical hit. Haste (Can move twice as far, can use one additional action or bonus action), Charge attack (Charges in a line, chance to knock hit players prone), Heave (throws a player into the air, critical fail deals additional attack with advantage).

Fossegrim (Demonic Water Spirit Bard):
Mist (Creates a thick mist, players unable to see unless right infront), Fanitullen (everyone who listens needs to do wisdom saves to not turn mad and start attacking randomly), Serenade of Water (cover terrain in deep water, becomes difficult terrain, if under water, wisdom save to not fall asleep), March of the Forest (Calls trees to life, orders them to attack nearest player), Wind of Doubt (A heavy wind blows over all players in a 60 foot radius, players must succeed a wisdom save or become depressed. Attacks on other players deal equal dmg to all depressed players as well. Other players may attempt to comfort depressed players as an action to rid their depression, roll a persuasion check).

Mare (Invisible Nightmare Demon):
While invisible, attacks against demon is done with disadvantage. May use bonus action to turn invisible, attacks turn demon visible. When turned visible, all players facing demon needs to pass wisdom save or be feared. Screech (deafening screech deals psychic dmg, pass a constitution save or be deafened). Whispering lullaby (all nearby players need to pass a wisdom save or fall asleep. At the end of your turn, pass a constitution save to wake up. 1-5 damage = roll a constitution save. &gt;5 damage wakes up). Nightmare (can only be used on players that are asleep or in deep sleep. Causes nightmare to either deal psychic dmg, cause sleep walk, or create illusion one turn. If deep sleep, deal physical dmg, sleep walk or create illusion each turn until passed wisdom save). Steal mind (Pass a wisdom save or  intelligence is reduced to 1 for 1 minute. Mare heals for how many points of intelligence has been reduced). Deep sleep (Pass a wisdom save or fall into deep sleep, physical or magic dmg do not cancel deep sleep. At the end of your turn, pass a wisdom save to return to regular sleep) Eternal slumber (can only be used on one player who is either asleep or in deep sleep. If only asleep, players roll 1 death save. If in deep sleep, gives automatic 1 failed death save. Waking up resets death saves).

Kraken + vikings:
Some cutthroat vikings lure you onto a ship. One of the vikings is sacrificed and thrown offboard. Three kraken tentacles appears and three vikings climbs the sails. Tentacle attack (A tentacle hits you, pass a dex save throw or be grappled). Submerge (If grappled by tentacle, can submerge player). Swipe attack (A tentacle swipes all nearby players, pass a strength save or be knocked prone). Ink attack (The kraken squirts out a massive ink attack, everyone in the water pass a constitution save or be blinded). Oil bomb attack (one viking throws an oil bomb, drenching an area of 30 feet in oil. The area is now considered difficult terrain). Fire arrow attack (shoots a fire arrow at one player, if drenched in oil, starts burning. If attacking oil spill, ignites oil). Arrow attack (hits one player with arrow).

Servant of Lodhurr (servant of the God of reanimation):
Found in the iron forest. In the Iron forest all players who move needs to pass a dex save or take dmg with a chance of bleed stack. The servant of Lodhurr can reanimate as anyone as a bonus action, temporarily gaining their stats, skills and spells. All damage dealt by bleeding is absorbed by the servant of Lodhurr healing it.

Huginn (thought) &amp; Muninn (mind):
Odin's two ravens. Stare (one of the ravens stares at you, do a wisdom save or be frozen by fear). Memory Siphon (Muninn attempts to take your memories, pass a wisdom saving throw or be inflicted by memory loss (must pass 3 wisdom saving throws to regain memories, if failed lose turn)), Mind Siphon (Huginn attempts to take your thoughts, pass a wisdom save or intelligence is reduced to 1), Insight (One of the ravens scans you, pass a wisdom save or all your attacks the next turn will be done with disadvantage. Hiding is disabled for the next turn. If moving or disengaging, raven does opportunity attacks with advantage), summon murder of crows (Summons a murder of crows that attacks all players. Huginn &amp; Muginn hides. All attacked players do perception checks with disadvantage).

Fenrir (Legendary wolf):
Snarl (Intimidates all players, roll wisdom saving throws or be frightened). Howl (Fenrir gives a loud howl, summoning 1-4 lesser wolves to fight for him). Hide (hides himself). Bite attack (bites a player, critical failure disarms player). Vengeful bloodlust (If one of his lesser wolves dies, increase Fenrir's damage by 1-4).

Brunnmigi (Defiler Demon):
Defile (standing within 30 feet of Brunnmigi makes you feel dirty. Upon heal, player healed must roll a con save. Failed save reduces heal by half.). Fling shit (flings a big shit at one player spreading it around, deal 1d6 necrotic damage. Terrain 30 feet around hit area becomes difficult terrain. Player rolls a constitution save or becomes defiled and causes other players standing 30 feet around  this player to feel dirty. Upon heal, players healed must roll a con save. Failed save reduces heal by half.). Contagious body (When brunnmigi successfully attacks or when a player hits Brunnmigi, roll a constitution save. Three failed saves inflicts a random contagion. Roll 1d10 to determine contagion). Slam (2d6). Decaying touch (Touch. you cause an object or creature to decay rapidly, the creature rolls a constitution save. Failed save takes 6d8 necrotic damage. Half on successful save. Inorganic objects take 3d8. Organic objects take 6d8.).

Dainn (Dead one), Dvalinn (Unconscious one), Duneyrr (Thundering one), Durathror (Thriving Slumber):
Four stags with their four dwarven riders that control the wind. Dead wind (A creeping wind that cannot be felt gives you a chill, something is not right. One player rolls a wisdom saving throw. If failed, all attack rolls, saves and checks are rolled with disadvantage). Unconscious wind (A shallow wind blows by one player making the player sleepy. Roll a wisdom saving throw or fall asleep). Thundering wind (a huge gust of wind hits one player, pushing you back. Roll a strength saving throw or be knocked prone). Snoring wind (A snore-like wind paralyzes one player. Make a constitution saving throw or be paralyzed). Hoof attack (The stag attacks you with their hoofs. If knocked prone, roll with advantage). Summon Eikthyrnir (When all stags are dead. All stags merge to summon Eikthyrnir).

Eikthyrnir (Legendary Stag of the four winds):
May use a bonus action to choose either dead and unconscious wind as an aura in a 30 feet radius, or a violent tornado winds from 30 feet away and outwards, dealing wind damage and reduces movement by half. Forceful wind (A wind either blows everyone towards or away from Eikthyrnir. Everyone rolls a strength check to not be knocked prone). Vibrating wind (An intense wind vibrates the area. Everyone rolls a constitution saving throw or become paralyzed). Up/downdraft (Summons a powerful wind that either blows everyone into the air (dex save) or down into the ground (strength save), reducing their movement by half or be knovked prone). Hoof attack (The stag attacks you with their hoofs. If knocked prone, roll with advantage). Antler attack (The stag attacks you with its antlers. If in the air or knocked prone, roll with advantage).

Not really inspired by norse mythology, but awesome nonetheless.

Glass dragon (in desert):
Phosphoromancy (can use action to become invisible, produce mirages or focus sunbeam), White rage (The glass dragon shoots a ball followed by a dragon spirit. The ball floats and the dragon spirit starts spinning the ball intensely, emitting blinding light and intense high frequency noise. Facing the ball blinds player with light. All nearby players are unable to concentrate (unless immune or under water)), Dust Breath (chance to cause bleed, and blinding), claw attack, bite attack.

Calcabrina (Demon doll boss):

DnD,DrowMonksAreFun,10,"Sorcerers in 5e Preface: not trying to convince anyone of anything or fix the class. These are just thoughts i wanted to put out there.

I love sorcerers, they are my second favorite class, i love the flavor, i love i woke up this way feel of the class. the running joke with sorcerers is that they are just a worst wizard, which i can see how you get there. They flat just know less spells, there are spells they just don't have access to, wizards beat them like punching bag when it comes to sheer versatility. So i see how it leaves people thinking so what is there to love. But to me Sorcerers are like a jazz musician, to the the wizards classically trained concert pianist.  Sure the the concert pianist knows all of the rules and is technically perfect and when you wanna hear Beethovens 5th he;s your guy. But jazz men they have a feel for music all their own, they know the rules as well but only so they know which ones to bend and which ones to break. They have a feel for the music in a way allows them to take the perfectly ordered domain of music and turn it on its head in such a way that from the seeming chaos of improvisation comes a style and musical blend all its own. 

This is what the sorcerer in 5e is almost like, its mostly there, but not quite. The general consensus iv seen online and in different conversations iv had is they need more spells, maybe a bloodline list that functions like the clerical domain spells. On the face of it that would be correct more spells would be nice but it wouldn't really help with their problem. That being metamagic doesn't do enough to overcome the deficiencies when compared to wizards. While metagmagic does a decent job as it stands,and the selections like distance spell, and twinned spells, quickened spell is a must and subtle spell to me never seems to get the respect it deserves. I think the biggest issue is that you only end up with 4 potential metamagic options and after you get your first choices at level three you don't get to pick another until level 10. at low levels you don't really have a lot of resources to work with so its not like you're going to  be doing a ton with your metamagic anyway. But if you select quickened spell that 2 sorcery points no matter what you're left with very little to use the sorcery points on. so if you go in favor of options that give you a little more flexibility in terms of cost you're stuck until 10 to get more options. 

personally i think this issue would could be mitigated by There having been metamagic options to change a spells elemental type (which showed up in the class variant unearthed arcana) and a metagmagic to change its area of effect (i.e changing whether it strikes in a line, a cone, or a a set radius). As well as having those be granted at level three and then being able to select options later and potentially more frequently. I just think having the option to change where a spell will strike or what element it will strike with would have gone a long way to make up for some of the versatility issues that sorcerers are stuck with. those two options would mitigate some of the effects of (theming your spells which i'm guility of) having the chance to do those would make me much more likely to spend one of my precious known spells on a purely utility spell and more readily fall into line with what a sorcerer could be. not just a worst wizard, but a spell caster who makes up for their lack of spell versatility by being able to wildly alter their spells, not just gimmicky shit like being able to throw a it farther.",1

Last night my bard got hit by confusion and was essentially a non factor for the five round/ 2 hour boss fight, and it feels bad. 

I sat on the sidelines listing to my friends struggling and getting KOed creeping towards a TPK and I couldn‚Äôt do anything, so I‚Äôm pissed off, my friends aren‚Äôt happy because they‚Äôd probably be doing better if I didn‚Äôt keep failing my saves and did something, and the Dungeon master is starting to feel bad because he doesn‚Äôt want to kill us all, and he doesn‚Äôt want me to have a bad time. 

So no one is happy in this situation. 

But it happens all the time! It‚Äôs too damn effective not to! I‚Äôve used hard CC and mind control in pathfinder, and although I‚Äôve tried to be careful with it, either everyone saves and it‚Äôs fine, or people don‚Äôt and it‚Äôs not fun. And I‚Äôve been on both sides of a player trivializing what should have been a difficult encounter with a spell, and that‚Äôs not great either. 


So what‚Äôs the solution? 


I don‚Äôt really know. 5th edition‚Äôs concentration mechanic is really great for this, but since this boss had a +9 con save, it didn‚Äôt really matter. 

Reducing the durations might help- but since most combats last three rounds anyway, and using your action to take one opponents action isn‚Äôt a good trade unless you outnumber them, I don‚Äôt see that working either. 

Have you guys had experiences with this?

DnD,ArastorWindwalker,4,"Potion of Rest - Homebrew Potion For context, I am DMing a group of three players: monk, fighter, and wizard. As they are a small group with no healing magic, they are very reliant on potions and rests. I have allowed the wizard to make healing potions with his alchemy supplies (as if he was using herbalism kit). However, it is not always possible to take a rest, so I thought I'd try and great a potion to help.

&amp;#x200B;

*Potion of Rest (very rare):*

*""The clear¬†silver liquid of this potion becomes cloudy when shaken, before clearing as it settles. Immediately after drinking this potion, you can spend 1 minute of down time to gain the benefits of a short rest. You cannot benefit from another potion of rest until you have finished a long rest.""*

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, this will not be an easy potion to get their hands on, nor to make. So they will have to be saved for times of extreme need!

Thoughts? I have worded it so it can't be used in combat, but is there any possible abuse I'm over looking?

 Wereshark 

Each form had access to blindsense up to 30 ft When submerged in water.

 Strength is increased to 18 if not already there.   

Alignment Changes to Chaotic.  

You can breath underwater in Hybrid or Shark form.  

Shifting is a Bonus action that can take you from any applicable form to any other and can be used 3 times between long rests.   

You gain the STR based ""bite attack"" and proficiency with it. You are capable or spreading the curse. In Melee you must make a INT DC 14 saving throw directly after initiative to avoid making your first melee attack each round a bite attack. 

You suffer a -2 persuasion and a +2 to intimidation checks when dealing with underwater or amphibious creatures with an INT over 5.

The aesthetic of your character changes slightly. Your teeth appear longer and your face more angular.

DnD,IPlayLacross1,7,"Why do so many players think sneak attack is limited to only DEX weapons? So this might just be me but it seems lots of players dont know you can use STR for a weapon and still get sneak attack as long as it meets the requirements.This has caused many arguments on and off the table.

The mechanic states

* you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) if you have advantage on the [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) roll. **The** [**Attack**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) **must use a** [**Finesse**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Weapons#h-Finesse) or a ranged weapon.

And Finesse works as followed

* When [Making an Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Making%20an%20Attack) with a finesse weapon, you use your **choice of your** [**Strength**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) **or** [**Dexterity**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Dexterity) modifier for the [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) and [Damage Rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Damage%20Rolls). You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

So with this any weapon that has finesse can use STR and also deal sneak attack damage.For example a [Shortsword](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Shortsword) is finesse so you can use STR for it and also have sneak attack damage.

I completely understand that using DEX is more optimal however i have had player's straight up say you can not do this and that using STR for sneak attack is a house rule.

Does anyone know where this idea of you can only sneak attack with dex attacks come from? Even in pathfinder you can sneak attack with a STR based weapon.

Was it an old edition that limit it to DEX?

I will spare you too many deta,but essentially it is an armor that behaves like one of the symbiote suits from the Spiderman comics. It would start as just a really good set of armor that one of the players would find and equip. At first I would let them know that it adds +2 to their AC and leave it at that. In the course of play, I would arrange for the players to get into a fight above their level and when things got really bad, the armor would activate, though I am not completely sure that is how I would play it (since obviously anything can happen in combat and I don't want to railroad them). The awoken armor would give the wearer access to two new abilities/spells:

-Once per long rest, you may ""activate"" armor during an encounter. For the duration of the encounter, you gain resistance to all non-magic attacks and you have advantage on all saving throws. At the end of combat, you receive one point of exhaustion. 

-Whenever you would be knocked unconscious by combat damage, you may instead temporarily reduce your maximum hit points by 2 instead of taking damage. At your next long rest, you must roll a successful Constitution check to regain the maximum hit points with a challenge rating of 12 plus 1 for every time this ability was used. If you fail the first night, you may try two more times before the hit points are permanently lost.

I'm not certain just yet about the exact mechanics, but this is the brainstorming process for me and I wanted to invite feedback on balance issues as well as any ideas for improvement or story hooks related to such an item. Of course if anyone happens to enjoy the idea, feel free to use it as well. Thank you!",1

The end of the campaign pits you against a horrible god-fetus attached to its mechanical yolk-sack. Its disturbing and also looks fairly difficult. The module expects you to be around 10-11th level when you go into the final fight.

However, when you finally defeat the proto-god (the actual objective of the campaign), an archlich planeshifts into the room and unleashes hell (as written, he warps in as soon as baby jesus bites the dust, so no real chance for the party to escspe or recover).

There is no way for a party of level 10's to defeat this archlich. The module gives you some help through special spiritual posession, but realistically its not nearly enough to help.

My dilemma: I know this campaign is a meat grinder, especially the final dungeon and that I dont have an issue with because its all of an appropriate challenge. They have to be smart, and things are more deadly, but all the stuff is reasonable for a party of level 7-10 to succeed at. People will probably die, but they had a reasonable chance at success and either they made a dumb mistake, or the dice went against them. Thats just DnD.

The archlich is not reasonable. He is a legendary villian from DnD lore, hes not a pushover by any sense of the phrase.

I dont want to trivialize a legendary DnD fixture just to let the party defeat him, but at the same time I feel like overcoming this massive dungeon only to be swatted down like a fly would feel very anticlimactic and a poor end to a story.

Do I not have him warp in and just leave him as a whispered rumor of who is responsible? Do I wipe the floor with the party to instill awe for a DnD icon? Do I ease up so the party has a chance to feel like heroes of legend at the expense of said icon?

None of those options sound all that great, so Im looking for outside advice. What are your opinions? What would you do in my situation?",1

DnD,IPlayLacross1,11,"Why do players think sneak attack has to be with a dex weapon? So this might just be me but it seems lots of players dont know you can use STR for a weapon and still get sneak attack as long as it meets the requirements.This has caused many arguments on and off the table.  


The mechanic states 

*  you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) if you have advantage on the [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) roll. **The** [**Attack**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) **must use a** [**Finesse**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Weapons#h-Finesse) or a ranged weapon. 

And Finesse works as followed

*  When [Making an Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Making%20an%20Attack) with a finesse weapon, you use your **choice of your** [**Strength**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) **or** [**Dexterity**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Dexterity) modifier for the [Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) and [Damage Rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Damage%20Rolls). You must use the same modifier for both rolls. 

So with this any weapon that has finesse can use STR and also deal sneak attack damage.For example a  [Shortsword](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Shortsword) is finesse so you can use STR for it and also have sneak attack damage.  


Does anyone know where this idea of you can only sneak attack with dex attacks come from?  
Even in pathfinder you can sneak attack with a STR based weapon.

Hello guys, i am currently working on the setting of a campaign where bleeding is an attainable Status Condition given certain factors, and i reworked something i found on Danwiki to make somewhat more sense, but i have the feeling it may be a bit too complicated, so i would like to ask if this makes sense, or maybe its a bit too broken. 

To give some context, the campaign is based on the game Kenshi by Lo-Fi games, where blood and individual limb damage are important to manage in combat.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bleeding

Every Character has a ""Blood Pool"" Under their resources on the character sheet.  


When  a weapon causes Piercing or Slashing damage, or  otherwise exposes flesh, if the character's HP is at or below half their maximum, the affected character must roll a Constitution  saving throw. On a failure, bleeding comes into effect. The DC of this  saving throw is unique to each severity level, as listed below.   


### Effects

The effects of Bleeding are as follows; 

There are five stages to bleeding and 4 levels of severity. 

#### Severity Levels

Level  One Severity: If a creature scores an attack roll that is 1-2 higher  than your AC, then the wound is minor, you have 3 rounds before the  Bleeding stages come into effect. DC 10. 

Level Two Severity: If a creature scores an attack roll that is  3-5 higher than your AC then the wound is alarming, you have 2 rounds  before the bleeding stages come into effect. DC 13. 

Level Three Severity: If a creature scores an attack roll that is  6-8 higher then your AC then the wound is serious, you have 1 round  until the bleeding stages come into effect. DC 15. 

Level Four Severity: If a creature scores a critical on their  attack roll, then the wound is crippling, The first stage of bleeding  comes into effect instantly. DC 18. 

#### Stages of Bleeding

Every  2 rounds (12 seconds) that a creature is bleeding, they must succeed a  DC 14 + Stage Constitution, upon failing a 2nd save or failing the first  by 10 points or more, the bleeding increases by one stage: 

¬†¬†¬† \- Stage One: Blood starts coming out of the wound, causing  you blood loss and dizziness. Your movement is impeded, you have  disadvantage on DEX saves.¬† You loose 1d4 blood units.  


¬†¬†¬† \-  Stage Two: Blood continues pouring out of the wound, causing you a  high amount of pain. Spells that require concentration will require you  make the CON save every¬† turn. You have disadvantage on STR checks.You  lose 1d8 blood units and take 1d6+2 necrotic damage.  


¬†¬†¬† \-  Stage Three: The would has ruptured a vein or artery due to physical  strain, you begin loosing blood quickly and your vision becomes blurry.  You gain disadvantage on Perception (WIS) checks that rely on sight. You  loose 1d12 blood units and take 1d10 necrotic damage.  


¬†¬†¬† \-  Stage Four: Enough blood is lost to make you fall, weakened (49 or less  blood units remain) and you become Stunned. You loose 1d20 blood units.  


¬†¬†¬†  \- Stage Five: The amount of blood loss causes you to loose your grasp  on life (15 or less blood units remain). You become Incapacitated.  


#### Treatment:

The treatment to this condition depends on the Stage of Bleeding:

¬†¬†¬†  \- Stage One: A Successful Medicine (WIS) Check of DC 14, or the use of a  Healers Kit, Bandages, Etc, Healing Potions or Healing Magic of any  level.  


¬†¬†¬† \- Stage Two: The use of a Healers Kit, Bandages, Etc. Greater Healing Potion, Lesser Restoration or Mass Healing Word.

¬†¬†¬†  \- Stage Three: The use of a Healers Kit, Bandages, Etc. plus a Medicine  (WIS) check of DC 15, Greater Healing Potion or Greater Restoration.

¬†¬†¬† \- Stage Three: Superior Healing Potion or Greater Restoration. 

¬†¬†¬† \- Stage Four: Supreme Healing Potion or Heal.

¬†¬†¬† \- Stage Five: Supreme Healing Potion or Heal. 

The  use of a healers Kit with a successful Medicine (WIS) Check of DC 14 +  Bleeding Stage past Stage two will stabilize the character and prevent further blood  loss for up to 2 hours, at which point the check must be repeated.  Medical Benches in town will suture the character for a price,  preventing further blood loss and incurring days of rest equal to twice  the stage of bleeding.",1

Believed to be creations of the Four Horsemen, astradaemons live out their existence in search of souls to harvest. These deadly creatures are ravening planar predators, openly hunting throughout the void for souls on which to feed. These voracious creatures are the personifications of death resulting from negative energy or level drain. Their vile touch drains life force from their enemies, and even perishing near them sates their thirst for life and souls.

Ecology Expanded

Diving out of the silver haze, this translucent, faintly phosphorescent [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) appears to be some fusion of a gaunt, eyeless giant, eel, and a monstrous jellyfish. With exaggeratedly long limbs and nearly a dozen ghostly tentacles that extend from its back, shoulders, and upper arms, the creature grasps about at everything near it, tentacles twitching like the sensory organs of a deep-sea predator.

Astradaemons appear as ghostly, faintly phosphorescent, rail-thin [humanoids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) with exaggeratedly long limbs. The fiends also have a seemingly random number of translucent tentacles trailing from their backs, shoulders, and upper arms, which wave and weave through the air.

Their bizarre forms possess heads that are skeletal, elongated, and vaguely piscine, reptilian, or canine, always bearing hungry rictus grins. Wicked, curved claws sprout from their hands and feet, and their tails move in rhythm with their tentacles, typically hanging toward the ground and almost doubling their length.

As the perpetually ravenous servitors of [Abaddon‚Äôs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-) archdaemons, the astradaemons‚Äô touch is corruptive and damaging to the spiritual material of souls. Their touch and especially their bite can cause horrific damage, akin to that of a [wraith](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/wraith), to anything they attack. Most feared, however, is their ability to utterly consume the souls of those killed in their proximity, feeding off of their essence or dragging it back to their fiendish overlords

Appearing blind at first glance, astradaemons have no visible eyes‚Äîwhat might have once been eye sockets are covered over by translucent hide. However, while any other creature might be considered crippled by such a deficiency, [Abaddon‚Äôs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-) soul-harvesters are unhampered by their condition. The fiends more than make up for lack of sight, sensing their environment through the constant movement of their tentacles‚Äîlike the ‚Äúvision‚Äù of many creatures who live in pitch darkness‚Äîand a supernatural awareness of souls.

Perhaps most disturbing, astradaemons exist in a uniquely translucent, semi-[incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) state. This property also allows them to somehow transition between planes with ease, and they often use the ability to flee pursuit, especially after glutting themselves on stolen souls.

Astradaemons never speak and rarely use their [telepathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-) to communicate with anything other than [daemons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons).

Astradaemons are the artificial creations of more powerful [daemons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons)‚Äîthe archdaemons, their greatest servitors, and a select number of non-aligned daemonic nobles. Though the gruesome and blasphemous details are restricted to the most powerful [daemons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons), the process by which astradaemons form begins with the forced amalgamation and rendering down of dozens of mortal souls into a screaming, conscious slurry of quivering soul-stuff. Over days and weeks, the soul-mass experiences unimaginable tortures, until at the apex of its maddening experience its masters fuse it with the spirit of another daemon (always a sacrifice rather than a willing act, usually as a punishment). Once combined with this daemonic essence, ritual magic and their creators‚Äô raw force of will then transmute the damned into their final twisted and blindly obedient form.

Just who first created the astradaemons is a mystery. Though the secret has since spread beyond the archdaemons, none of them claim the act as their own, leading some to attribute the act to one of their longsince deposed and now nameless predecessors, or even the mythical Oinodaemon.

DnD,HendrixJ21,3,"Forge domain cleric got involved with eldritch knight powers Hello everyone,

So first time player, I have a half elf forge cleric (Gond, god of the forge) who's also multiclassing with 3 levels of fighter becoming an Eldritch Knight. I'd like some bit of flavor in this change for him getting here but haven't been able to get anything good out of my own imagination. Also only experiences he's had with the eldritch is a warlock party member and a town that had been changed due to the presence of a warlock as well.

Also idk if this helps but he'll be picking up fire bolt, ray of frost, expeditions retreat, find familiar, and alarm when taking the class.

Any comments, concerns, smart remarks for the betterment of the whole is appreciated!",1
DnD,braknar22,0,"my first experience as a DM      I just finished my first ""one-shot"" (im not sure what to call it because it was over three sessions) it took place in the world of our main campagin with the DM playing a character and a new player. I wanted to DM and my friend wanted to join so we thought this would be a good way to introduce her character.
     The first session had the PCs get taken into a alternate reality that was basically willy wonka candy land where they were tested by the god of mischief. I had them go through a dungeon fighting some hobgoblins wearing rock candy armor and using rock candy swords. they had to get pass a puzzle and then kill two yeti's. the session ended with them getting back to the real world where one of the PCs was killed by one of the gods. This was the DM's character and he said he wanted to be killed so i killed him and we had an npc from the kain campagin show up and he played them. 
      The second session picked up and they were trying to get to the city that the characters from the main campagin were. It took place on a boat controlled by cultists that worshipped a vampire. the cultsists werent to hard but the boss was a vampire spawn so I thought that it would be a decently hard fight and it probably would have been if it wasnt for one of the PC's banishing the vampire spawn to the realm of the sun god. Nothing else really happend that session but I did do some railroading but im trying do that less now.
       The last session was on the boat still and they were now entering a ""sea of monsters"" area where they were attacked by merrow. Once they defeated the merrow they found a hag eye on one of the dead bodys the decided to not try and find the hags and continued on. 
Eventually they were attacked by a ghost ship. The final boss on the ship was a gladiator ghost who's stats i had boosted to make the fight harder but i rolled so bad that he got one hit in and then got killed after three rounds of the initiative order. I wasnt going to have them fight the hags but since the fight was so easy i had a coven of three hags show up and fight them. The players then proceeded to kill one of the hags in a single round so they couldnt cast magic anymore and they them easily. the session ended with thwm arriving in the city where the party of the main campagin was.
        Overall it was a very fun experience despite all getting essentially one-shot by the party.",1

DnD,Ayserra,5,"Blood Hunter: Crimson Rite Clarification This is a follow up to my High Elf Blood Hunter Question 

*As a bonus action, you can activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren‚Äôt holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table.*

So my reading of this is that you can do your Rite two ways. First way is the **BA: Rite during Combat. If get disarmed/switch weapon, lose Rite** that's all good.

Bit iffy with the second one, so wanted to see how others rule it. Since it says * lasts until you finish a short or long rest* I'd take that to mean you could either **after party done SR/LR, do your Rite and it'll stay on even with weapon sheathed** or **party is wandering through the woods, you don't like the feeling so you unsheathe your weapon..Rite it...then sheathe it and the Rite stays**

Am I correct with the second one? That your Rite sticks even with weapon sheathed and the **in your hand** is only for combat?",1

DnD,timelord358,7,"1st draft of 5E Axolotl Race i'm working on, The Axolotian  

**The Axolotian**

**Short and Rotund:**

Axolotian‚Äôs are often seen as cute and cuddleable for their races ‚ÄúBaby face‚Äù syndrome, the adults just looking like bigger versions of the young. They normally stand smaller than 4 1/2 Ft tall and have rounded and somewhat squishy bodies. They are reptilians with wide, dopey smiles and external gills that are sometimes mistaken for hair or antenna.

Axolotian Scale colors have vast ranges, with different subsets of these colors meaning vast differences in Their society, because of their vast color pallet colors have gained great importance in Axolotian communities.

Because of their natural fortitude Axolotian‚Äôs tend to be somewhat clumsy but well meaning and jovial, they make quick friends. They can be quite naive and are often taken advantage of, even if they normally forgive those who have wronged them, they tend towards forgiving rather than retribution.

Axolotian‚Äôs are flexible and adaptive to most situations, going with the flow like the rivers and lakes they tend to call home. They are always up for helping those in need, letting total strangers into their lives if they‚Äôre in need and helping them, this often leads to them being scammed.

Beauty and colors are of vast importance to Axolotian‚Äôs, and they tend to decorate themselves and their surroundings with colorful trinkets.

Individual Axolotian‚Äôs are Friendly and open, eager to make friends with any they meet and are accepting of others faults thanks to a live and let live attitude. Many Axolotian‚Äôs have a strong sense of Found family, caring more for those they live with and spend most of their time with then those of their own blood who they don‚Äôt see all to often, often seeing their closest friends as Brothers and sisters, as such they tend to be extremely loyal to those they care for.

**Tribes and Communities:**

Axolotian Settlements are rarely only Axolotian‚Äôs as they‚Äôre open and welcoming of others. It's easy to find Settlements that are full of other races as well, these other races are still treated as members of the tribe as if they were born into it.

Axolotian‚Äôs like to see the most qualified person lead and as such most of their tribes are run on a democratic system, with the whole group coming together and deciding through a vote on who is best to lead through merit.

Axolotian Villages are always found on the edges of rivers or lakes doe to their amphibious nature, and tend towards farming and fishing in these areas

**Axolotian Names:**

Axolotian‚Äôs don‚Äôt have gendered names, as their names often reference one or many of the colors on their bodies and, later in life, what they do, as such Axolotian‚Äôs have 2 name their Birth name referencing a color and a adult name which they choose for themselves when they find their calling, these names are then combined in some way to form their full name.

**World description:** 

Fifty years after the great siege of Waterdeep, the city has comeback stronger and more thriving than ever before. With the Wards rebuilt and redesigned new areas have formed, and new guilds have come up. In the center Castle Ward was the worst hit but has come back the strongest, from the ashes the Blackstaff Tower was left standing and from there a new central government was formed and a new building called Waterdeep Hold was constructed in place of the old Castle Waterdeep. 

Along the shore the Dock Ward was decimated and was the hardest to rebuild but with the help of the **Habbak Docks** guild the ward was back to it‚Äôs former glory, now with the leadership of it‚Äôs stern and brash quartermaster Fehlyn, a woman who cares for her fellow shipmates and the people of the sea, trade has comeback tenfold. 

During all of the fighting and siege the North Ward was transformed into the new religious center of Waterdeep with temples to Illmater, the Lawful Good god of endurance, Lliira, the Chaotic Good goddess of joy, Oghma, True Neutral god of knowledge, and Silcanus, True Neutral god of nature, can be found and many other smaller shrines have popped up along with them. Many new pilgrims find their way to Waterdeep on there trek to find enlightenment and wisdom.

Even with everything that happened the Southern Ward has always been a busy and bustling as ever as new adventurer guilds and merchants moved in. The biggest of these guilds is **Tymora‚Äôs Adventurers** a thriving and well-loved guild by adventurers from all around. It‚Äôs headmistress, a Tobaxi woman by the name Velvet Wonder, Vel for short, is known to be caring and fair as well as a mother figure to those of the guild. Another guild has popped up more recently and is lead by Tiefling twins Aniqine and Dorza. They run the **Olida Entertainers** guild, a smaller guild set to spread the religion of **Olidammara** and his revelry. Aniqine can be quite flirtatious and bubbly and her sister Dorza can be a handful since she can be hot headed and straight forward, both are mainly carefree and over sexual for the most part.

Last of the Wards that need to be rebuilt was the Trade Ward, with most of it being left in ashes it was soon rebuilt with a central trading guild pulling in the business and coin to help the process along. The **Shinare Traders** guild was set and has grown to be the biggest in the ward but has come under new leadership as Kobold triplets somehow worked their way up through the ranks and was handed the role from previous guild master. Sass, Nix and Deri have been doing a wonderous job building new trade agreements, arrangements and being fair to all the different merchants and traders coming to Waterdeep. Sass is the youngest sister of the trio is carefree, flirtatious, and daring when it comes to finding new trade routes, while her brother Nix is the quick witted and sly one who deals with the more troublesome merchants. Their eldest brother Deri is the brains and go between when it comes to disputes and new laws concerning goods and trades.

With all that has happened and all the new guilds and religions popping up in and around, Waterdeep has come back bigger and busier than ever before. With the new guilds, new walls and a new city coming to life many have flocked to the city for it‚Äôs wonders, trade and adventure. Who knows what you‚Äôll find and who you‚Äôll find wandering the streets of Waterdeep. Will you find adventure, religion or are you here to set up shop and make it rich. Only time will tell if things will continue to prosper or if something even worse if boiling down in the Underdark.",1

DnD,OverDemon,23,"How to make a ""Hell Knight"" character? (Seeking assistance in a character build) Inspired by characters like Archaon from Warhammer Fantasy and Agrael from Heroes V, I've looked into the possibility of creating a ""Hell Knight"" like character for my next game. However, while I have a few ideas I'm on the lookout for more and a second opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

By ""Hell Knight"" I imagine an armored, martial character who has some form of supernatural abilities that can be connected to the Abyss or the Nine Hells or look like it *(fire/""evil"" spells/abilities)*. I'm not sure about race yet, have considered tiefling, but am leaning towards human since that's generally what these characters are in fiction.

Possibilities for character build that have come to mind are:

**Fighter/Warlock** \- With Fiend patron because that just makes sense. I imagine the divide would be 18/2 or 17/3.

**Paladin** \- Oath of Conquest from Xanathar's Guide. They are even called hell knights in the description. Some multiclassing with warlock could be possible.

It's a private game I'm attending, and we do homebrew to a degree, so I imagine there might also be the possibility of doing a little of that with this character.

&amp;#x200B;

So, have anyone out there seen an epic example of this in their own games or maybe carried around the perfect idea for this? Really interested in what you have to say and appreciate any help.",1

DnD,ZachGurney,13,"[5e] Advice on how to take over a city  I'm looking for ideas on how to take over the main starting city in my campaign. The city is a relatively large city who is ruled by a duke. This duke's father came to power through a rebellion a while ago but when he took control he set up a ""temporary"" counsel and he basically was a king, and now the current duke took over. He is currently holding a gladiator tournament in honor of his father which our party is participating under the sponsorship of a minor lord, the reward being a poop load of gp, and 1 wish/ Our team consists of a teifling sorcerer (me), a halfling bard/warlock, and human fighter (who's a knight of the city), and a dwarven cleric (who doesnt always get along with the fighter) and we're all lvl 8. I honestly dont think that taking over this city on my own would be too difficult because magic is really rare here and im probably the most powerful caster in the city. The main problem is my entire part is good aligned and would try and stop me if they found out i was trying to take over the city.

Oh, and the docks district, which is the poorer area of town despite the city depending on the sea trade, doesnt agree with the Duke all that much and have their own union.

So, here are my resources. I have a few spells that would be of huge help (confusion, alter self, familiar, ect)as well as good combat spells, i have about 300gp, i have a contact in the dock workers union whos a big deal smuggler, (but while he knows me he doesnt really owe me anything), i have a friend whos part of a weird assassins guild (also doesnt owe me anything, and is close friends with the fighter), and finally I found out recently that the dukes wife is having a affair with the fighter.

My plan is to start by sneaking around the docks at night and using the Thaumaturgy spell to make random houses look haunted (weird lights, slamming windows and doors, baby cries) and then in the morning, going to the houses and promising to repel the demons for cheap (5-10 cp) but ill really just use presidigitation to make symbols and then just not touch those houses again. This will earn me trust with the dock people as well as some pocket change. I then plan on going to a tavern and telling the owner ill make all his food and alcohol taste better (prestidigitation) for 30% of the profit so that I can make some decent money over time. And instead of blackmailing the dukes wife with the info i have i plan on converting her. i plan on Telling her i can make it so her and the fighter can be together if she does what i say, while disguised using alter self. I might ""accidentally"" hurt the fighter after this so shes more desperate.

Now, after this im not sure what to do. Start a smuggling business to make more money? Start undermining the royalty? Start buying up all the farms around the city? Any advice you have will be appreciated.",1
DnD,SpliterCbb,10,"Healing spells and narrative injuries in story-oriented adventures Hi!  
I'm planning out a few sessions ahead, and there's a couple of situations where narratively it'd make sense to have an ally NPC on death's door reveal some critical information, and then die for dramatic effect.  


The issue is that the entire party has healing spells, and whenever I had them interacting with an NPC that was badly injured they always tried to heal them.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is for DMs and Players in story-oriented adventures:

**DMs: How do you deal with such situations? Do you just let the players heal them, or do you explain that they can't be healed, did you find other solutions that players liked/leaved narrative possibilities?**

**Players: If you've ever been in a situation like this, did you feel cheated that you couldn't heal the NPC, was there ever a solution to this where you felt satisfied with the outcome?**

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I have in mind is that a healing spell wouldn't outright heal them, but it would restore their HP and temporarily stabilize them, that way if there is an NPC in the future that they can heal even with difficulty they could do so.",1

DnD,Kinger1000,2,"Team B!!! So... This is something I did in a D&amp;D session a couple days ago that I decided I'd share as a DM. My players are playing through Ghosts of Saltmarsh and have obtained a ship. However a ship needs more than just 4 people to sail. Thus they began recruiting others. Such as characters they meet in other quests. (I'm throwing in a fair bit of homebrew quests and not sticking to the book).

What ended up happening is they had a crew of 8 people. 4 of which were... Special in their own ways. 

One was a Sea Elf they saved from pirates. Another was a Super intelligent Rat that was magically transformed into a Dwarf (Due to fun/silly story reasons). Then there was a Bugbear they freed from captivity. And finally a Kobold which received divine enlightenment from a god.

We joked one day about them being heroes in a separate quest on the sidelines. But then one of my players said they weren't feeling well and didn't wanna go to D&amp;D that night. 

So I figured- ""Why not?"" and had a 'Team B' session. Where the other 3 players picked one of the 4 and I controlled the last one. It turned into a fun side story that actually contributed to the plot line of the 4  main characters greatly.

I'm sharing this because I see a lot of posts/videos of people saying something like- ""Someone couldn't make it this week so he just wasn't there."" or something. Instead, maybe have a 'Team B' type of session where you can give the players another perspective on everything and perhaps even help 'Team A' in the long run.",1
DnD,IRubOffToFoodIDrop,25,"New to DMing and I already hate the first sessions I am DMing for the first time with some people on discord. In pure excitement, I spent a few days before the first session homebrewing. I based it off some Rimword stuff where an entire continent was overrun by Insectoids and the party managed to hitch a ride on a large boat filled with hundreds of people where they sail towards a new continent, to make themselves a new home.

The party consisted of:

-A dragonborn monk

-An old human wizard who used to be a librarian 

-A blond guy with a uniform

They start at level 3

Now first session the blond guy player didn't join because he was busy, so I'm left with the monk and the old guy. It was pretty uneventfully save for the wizard having to break open a door because they monk wouldn't give him the key without payment. They fought an Insectoid that clung to the side of the ship, and the session ended with the ship sailing towards the new continent.

Now before the next session (next week) started, I asked the blond guy player about his character. he says that he wants to keep the character sheet a secret from me and I allowed it, knowing him I thought he would surprise me.

For the second session it was just the monk and the blond guy that got in the session. (Wizard player dropped out of the campaign because he'll be busy with school) 
The ship has landed on shore and I have the captain NPC ask the players to help out with unloading some cargo. They fought another Insectoid that was hiding in storage and found out it ate a lot of the supplies. The blond guy got grabbed by the Insectoid and got out with a +13 str saving throw.

Nighttime comes and the people are happily drinking over a large bonfire after the monk Nat 20s on performance. The blond guy notices a lot of red dots moving along the dark, and one of the dots is right on him. They try to catch it but it managed to escape, they could only hear the sounds of countless beeps.
The next day, the captain asks the players if they also say those red dots, the blond guy did and the monk was drunk. I try to get them to start investigating on it but monk decided to gather food in the woods and the blond guy started chopping down trees...with his fist.
I then realized that the blond guy was a stand user this entire time. 
The monk tries to kill a noble that managed to also escape on the ship and the session ended there.

Now I am upset about this, the monk is just trying to kill people and the blond guy didn't even fit the setting. Knowing the monk player, I expected him to murderhobo since in all honesty he's kind of a dick but I really didn't see it coming from the stand user player. I tell him to change his character and he does.

The third session starts and he brings out a new character and it's another monk. To try and make sense of his last character dying, I do a week timeskip and they come back to the settlement now build up and a perimeter wall. The wall was made when the settlers realized that there was something out there killing them. (Steel spikes killed a few of them)
Now the captain calls for the party to help look into what's shooting them in the dark then the two monks decide to fight each other. I allow them to have a rumble but then the new monk decided to use quivering palm. I raise my eyebrow at this and tell him that it's a level 17 monk ability.
He then tells me that his monk is actually level 20, and as for the stand user from earlier? Level 21.

It was midnight, I wanted to sleep and now I hear this shit. I just left the discord call there and ended the session, I then went to sleep. I don't even know what to do anymore, the campaign has been fucked ever since session 1 that I felt like ending it altogether.

I woke up this morning and talked to him about it, he said that he swears he'll make a serious character this time and sends me a gsheet for a level 3 character. As for the monk player he just told me to stop being a little bitch about it, because he's still having fun, though I guess me having fun doesn't matter.

I now plan on redoing the entire thing In a new setting, but I still feel so disheartened by the weeks worth of stuff I've been writing going in the trash. The session starts in around 8-9 hours and if I get another stand user I'm just dropping the campaign.

Continues to clarify that ""Opportunity attacks trigger when an enemy you are targeting leaves your range."" (which reading the rules several times, says no, of course, DMs rules!)

To be honest, these are legitimate claims, and it makes perfect sense what my DM is saying. *Do you agree or disagree with him?* (In my games, I would just allow it, I sort of believe that he did this to partially 'nerf' our party, because letting us get this opportunity attack would have killed the wolf and might have removed some small difficulty from the encounter.)

People probably have stranger tales, but this one is mine.

We start our adventure as all good ones do. In a tavern, in the Town of Phandalin.

Our Party consists of: A Wizard Warfroge by the name of Connor Construct, he is also an Engineer of the Izzet League. A rather ok fellow, if more robotic than your usual Warforge

An Elf Paladin named Gloom Silver Gale, quiet and hard to hear but a great tank and warrior in a fight

A Simic Scientist Former-Elf Barbarian named Silas Galbrigol. I say former as due to his background, he now looks like a Crocodile (due to a misunderstanding, the party thought he looked like an anthropomorphic Magikarp for a while). Good friends/colleague of Connor much to his (feigned) chagrin.

A Human Druid named Kathika. Local Flower Girl and happiest person in the party. Despite my description, she was definitely the most likable person in the group.

And Me: A Human Variant Hunter (homebrew based on Bloodbourne), a Far Traveler by the name of Llyod Cainhurst. Coming in with a Werewolf Skull and pale eyes on the prize of the secrets to hunting good.

Everyone in the Party had an heirloom, this is important. Mine was a dagger, which I didn't learn until the second session was the Dagger of Broken Mirrors.

My party gathered, some thugs tried to deter me from the bar, but we made ourselves more trouble than we were worth, so they went away. Llyod took a liking to the party and their incessant bickering. Silas and Connor being of note for arguing like an old married couple. Kathika actually decided that was a good time to enter. A cheery flower girl, whose niceties actually indeared Llyod to her, going so far as to keep the head of the flower she gave him.

The party took their first quest to warn a local midwife of a Life God about a White Dragon in the area. Her house/windmill was being attacked by a Manticore. Pretty standard 1st level stuff. So we quickly moved onto the Second Quest, we were to warn some Dwarven Archeologists of the Dragon.

It took a while to get there and on the way, we found the corpse of a Displacer Beast, cut to pieces by numerous blades and axes. Llyod managed to find a Red Fang. \*Bad Feeling\*. The way was still around a day's travel, so we stopped for the night and made camp. I decided to go hunting and Kathika decided to follow along. With a resounding 'ok' I challenged her to a race. We ran around, with me leading her on a goose chase, building up to a scare. Before she looked up to see me hiding in a tree about to jump. We had a laugh, avoided some Konosuba level fun with a Giant Toad and his Winter Themed Buddy, and went back to camp. Somewhat important detail. She also makes a crown of flowers for Connor. Touching scenes all around.

So we continued on our way until we managed to get to the Dwarves. They were fine but wanted our help clearing out some Slimes that are making the excavation harder. Cue Ochre Slime fight and telling party members that ""No, the is not an Ogre Slime you fool. Don't give the DM Ideas"". We cleared them with some difficulty leaving Silas at around 7 hp. Connor left the exploration to us and went to the entrance. A few minutes later we here over a communication stone we were given the Connor was having some troubles.\*Very Bad Feeling\*

Connor runs back inside and gives us enough warning to hide. I hid within a ruined building as cover, Silas was ready at the door, Kathika right behind him, Connor was hiding in a building, and Gloom was behind a corner.

Silas was instantly downed by a spear and took Red Fang of Shaagas double scimitars to the face, dying almost instantly. Most of us saw the painting on the wall and made to hide. But Kath's player wasn't able to attend that night and her character was given to the DM. He's not bad, but he should have placed her character better. Especially after we all started to run.

Kathika had wild shaped into a bear. In the span of two attacks, she was brought out of it and was killed via massive damage. 10d6 + 9 if I recall. We were level 2 when these guys should up. Me, Connor, and Gloom all went for a hiding spot. Gloom went for some secret tunnels we found earlier, I hid behind a ruined house, and Connor decided to hide in another ruined building using minor illusion to appear as a pile of rocks.

Red Fang cast darkness. Connor noticed him coming his way. An Orc investigated the house I was in, I killed him and hid under his corpse. Gloom made it to a safe hiding spot. Connor pushes Red Fang away dispelling the darkness and makes for the tunnels. The Orcs give chase. Red Fang heads for my building and I cross my fingers. Connor makes it to the tunnels leaving the Orcs for a loop.

Red Fang finds my corner. I am under the corpse of the orc. I don't move a muscle. He moves the corpse, I am OOC have hands shaking with adrenaline. He puts his ear to my body. My heart stops. He moves on. And I am still alive.

Red Fang and his Orcs continue to search the ruins. I decided that I should cut my losses and I ran and didn't stop running until I got back to Phandalin. Silas' backup was there, a Sea Elf Bard named Loreley. I retold my story as far as I could remember it. Whiskey to keep me from fully breaking down as I realized I left the rest of my party to die. Both me and Loreley head off to the ruins, she apparently had a message to Silas from the Simic Combine. We meet up with Connor and Gloom, they had the Dwarves with them carrying Silas and Kathika's corpses.

We arrange a funeral for them once we got back to Phandilin. Kathika's father owned a flower shop in town, I gave him the flower head she gave me and gave my condolences. On the day of the funeral, Lincon (Kathika's father) placed the flower on her casket.

Now this is where shit hits the fan. After the funeral, I go hunting and experience a... ascension. The whole town for a week could hear my rampage and newfound abilities. When I come back, I am physically changed. My arms bulge and writhe under my sleeves. I now where the Werewolf Skull I once used as a trophy as a mask. My character seemed to lose all passion he had the week before.

Connor has decided to honor Kathika

Meeting back up with the group, I suggested to them that we as a calm down from last week visit a conclave of Gnomes for their trinkets. They agreed and we moved on. We finish the quest quite handily. Killing a Mimic who convinced me it was a rock (Nat 20 Persuasion, that's how). When given access to a vault that was haunted... by Kathika's ghost. The reunion was pretty (for a lack of better words) melancholic. She didn't seem to know why she was back, just that she was. We took her back to town but kept her hidden as we turned the quest in. We decided to take her to see her dad.

She hitched a ride in my head. But I had two things on me. BoooOooOots: a cursed item that caused me to hear the moans of the dead when there were undead around (i.e. a Ghost in my head) and my heirloom had a Demon bound in it. a Shoosuva to be precise. It told her to fuck off and when she realized what it was, she gave it the headspace and mingled with the moans of the damned.

When she came out, we were at the flower shop. Her dad was terrified, Gloom blocked the door so he wouldn't run away. Kathika tried to reason with him, but Lincon wouldn't hear it. He buried his daughter and to him, this spirit was a demon. Gloom was going to force or guilt him into seeing reason, but I intervened. Grappling Lincon with tentacles that were under my sleeve, I held onto him while Kathika grabbed her stuff from her room. Putting them into Gloom's pouches before hopping into his head and leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

Leaving me alone with the father.

I then took him to the back and took my time to kill him. Kathika was the closest person in the group to me. When she died, my character went a little crazy, becoming Old Blood Kin certainly didn't help. Now Kathika was back and Llyod was as close to ecstatic as his condition allowed. Now Lincon, on the other hand, rejected what Llyod saw as a true miracle and hurt his own daughter's feeling in a way that would likely hurt her forever.

So my now inhuman Hunter under the influence of the Demon in his Dagger slowly killed and ate him. Connor did pop by, but I told him enough half-truths that he didn't want to press the already known deranged hunter, leaving me to finish my work. So I went to the woods and hid the head. After a few days, a search party was organized for Lincon. I planned accordingly. 

Now the thing about my dagger is that things I kill with it, I can assume the form of. So I disguised myself as Lincon and went to the edge of the woods. Connor who joined the search spotted me out of the corner of his eye and followed me into the woods. I used my tentacles, absurd Acrobatics and stealth to evade him. Taking on the form of both Lincon and a werewolf I killed, I began to let out inhuman roars. Connor Intimidated, as I got closer and closer, bravely ran away.

He caught a glimpse of my Linconthrope form before I broke off. I joined up with a search party away from Connor and told them of how I saw a beast that I planned to kill. Connor unintentionally helps my story with tales of a Werewolf Lincon roaming around.

This whole time I had been messaging the DM, the Party knew it was me but didn't know how I was doing it.

A few days later, I left town. A day and a night after, I come back with the head of Lincon. A hero to the people.

DnD,metricsonicjosh,6,"ranger hombrew subclass in the T H E M E of talion from the middle earth :shadow of series seeing as i rarely get an opportunity to play atm, quite new only started less than a month or two ago, i wanted to try to start a project to understand the mechanics of the game better, specifically home brew, so far whenever i look into home brew i try to find a way to directly inject character traits into dnd (fate/stay night tracing and drivers and blades from xenoblade 2) i wanted to try to either find or make a SUBCLASS rather than a full class that adds three of my favorite non ranger like things talion has in shadow of war. 

first and the easiest is the flow, specifically how many teleports he has. he can use shadow strike consuming an arrow to blink huge distances for an attack, or a cheep short blink for a dodge at later levels or from stealth in lower levels. so the first item im looking for is easy access to teleport like moves. 

the second is his domination. in the game it is three fold, first he can drain targets for health (no way i can see this practically done in dnd, bonus points if you can find something that makes it work), second he can ""interrogate"" enemies aggressively and invasively reading minds for whatever information he seeks. and finally he can essentially hypnotize people into fighting for ad serve him.

the final part and honestly im thinking the hardest part to balance both statistically and lore wise is how he fights two as one. in the game you can counter two opponents at once by sending your wraith out to parry the second, and you can simultaneously execute opponent using the same method.

these are the three things i want to see in a ranger subclass. im not looking to recreate talion point by point only take the most interesting parts of his move set that isn't just ""ranger"" to put into this game to make something similar. the reason i am posting is to either find the closest possible mach as by the consensus of the dnd community or to gain advice as to how to make this myself",1

DnD,PancakeMeister9000,15,"PC contaminated by The Plague. Ideas Hi.

So one PC was hanging around in a plagued village, selling beer and sandwiches (cause that's what he does, I mean if he's having fun, why not). On the way in he saw a man pushing a cart full of dead people, he talked to that man, he then knew for sure that people are dying from the plague, yet he proceeds with his plan.

Then he failed a Constitution saving throw couple of times and i guess narratively he certainly got contaminated. Days go by, I tell him ""you do sweat a lot today"" ""it feels no matter how much water you drink, you still thirsty"". He either ignores it or just thinks I put it there for a flavour.

So 10 days passed. And I think lesser restoration can't really help him now. He is considered exhausted to the 2nd lvl and unable to benefit from long rest. Luckily one of other players connected the dots and understood what's happening to his friend.

My question is. I didn't think he will let it go so far. And it turned into a side quest where they'd have to find a way to cure PC, or soon enough he will be dead.

This particular group is notorious for not picking up on hints, so I often have to make things obvious for them because they never seem to get it when I give them a puzzle. So, I tried to make it obvious something was off when they entered a room. It went something like this;

Me: You enter a small room with very few furnishings. There's a large, fancy bed, covered in dust and mold, as well as a broken dresser and a shattered mirror. On the other side of the room, there is a large fireplace, and right next to it lie the bodies of six stirges. Their blood was still liquid and warm, as if they had been killed very recently. The room appeared to have been looted, almost as if it had been disturbed only moments ago after being left to decay for years. 

My players were under the impression that they were alone in this dungeon and none of them had killed those stirges. I figured this would be an absolutely blatant clue that something wasn't right. But my players chose to investigate the mirror and take a shard of glass and then leave the room without even mentioning or questioning it. 

I continued to try to get them to run into trouble but they managed to evade every attempt and made it out of the dungeon unscathed. I let it slide, as one of my players happened to have a betrayal plot going that came into play this session, but damn, they're very dumb and lucky.",1

i.e. a character fails a save and gets a short term madnes one day (1d10 minutes) the next day fails another save (1d10 hours) and the next day fails yet another save he gets an indefinite madness (until cured).  


the way I read the rule is that the effect only gets worse if the character fails a save while the prevoius madness was in effect.

Logically, unless this means that booming blade makes a whip like affect made of thunderous energy: No. As in description of the spell, the weapon is covered in thunder energy.

*However*  using the somantics of the description aswell as the PHB(i believe so correct me if wrong), 5ft can be considered a ranged attack, although unlikely. So more than likely it is up to DM descretion.

Guthark the Goliath Barbarian and Silly the Gnome Rogue
Guthark Hammersmash Olavi-kantai comes from the Kantai tribe, known for their metalworks. Unlike his charasmatic father Eglath, Guthark was a shy boy with a stutter. He was given the name Hammersmash in hopes he would become a great blacksmith following in his mother Kelara's footsteps. He never developed a talent to contribute to the tribe and was cast out at the age of 15, being told he might as well succumb to the cold of the mountain if he won't practice at the hearth. As he made his way down the mountain and into the hillside at the base, he accidentally crushed Shayla Inalia Lede Lilo Yamanti (her friends call her Silly) house. Turns out Silly was an outcast as well. She comes from a family of tinkerers but always got caught stealing others inventions and taking credit (albiet jokingly, she always have real credit to the original owners in the end). She enjoyed it keeping a bit, but was never really good at it, she was better at being sneaky and copying others ideas. Both being outcasts they became the best of friends. Guthark was very quiet, a Stark contrast to the quite talkative Silly. Guthark being 8'4 and Silly being meager 2'9 made for an interesting pair. Their relationship became more than just friends, but a true partnership. They settled in the countryside, Guthark made a nice cabin and Silly tinkered out a few things (copies of his relatives inventions) to make life easier for the two of them. With the size difference there was a lot of maneuvering to make life easier for Silly. For example to use the kitchen she made a scooter that lifted her to the counter. She made extensions for all the handles, although she still had Guthark stoke the fires. They lived quite happily like this for a couple years but Silly yearned to find more inventions to steal...ideas...about. She missed the husstle and bustle of town life. She heard take of a great tinkerer in a town up north. Guthark missed being active too, wrestling with his family, seeing who could best who. He missed competition. Just so happened that the same town of the rumored tinkerer also had rumored strongman competitions. It seemed odd that so.ething they both wanted and yearned for would be in the same town, especially with them being such different interests, but they decided that a little adventure may be just what they needed. So Guthark packed up his trusty hammer, and Silly strapped away her daggers for who knew what would come. She also packed gutharks oversize pack with everything they could possibly need, outfitting it with a small chair for her to ride on his back and head out. They managed to sell their cabin for a healthy sum to help them on their travels. And on they went. 

Guthark is 8'4, bulky and has short white hair, another reason he was shy. He had a tattoo of a blacksmith hammer on each of his arms. He wasn't chiselled, but fit. He wore simple clothes
Silly is 2'9 and loves to live life to the fullest and her wardrobe matched her personality. She work dark baggy pants and fitted t shirts with an often time charmed cloak. It was bright colors but was charmed to confuse people, making her stealthy. She is known to wear cat ears in a bid to appear unassuming and cute although she is deadly accurate with her daggers.",1

Does this mean that my character can make educated deductions around the nature of a spell, and learn it on their own between level gains? Or am I restricted to the DM remembering that I'm a wizard and throwing me the odd bone in the form of a spell scroll or dusty old spellbook?

Are there ways that I can learn spells on my own that doesn't make it seem like I'm tiptoeing around the DM or waiting for him to let me learn a spell?",1

DnD,PretzelFreakout2017,4,"Four Elements Monk Everyone seems to know that the Four Elements Monk in 5e stinks because it uses too much ki, which is a very limited resource at lower levels. It also sort of forces a monk into focusing on one element until high levels, which is just... Not as fun.

There are a bunch of proposed updates out there, and so far my favorite is probably nerdarchy's. I haven't heard too much about it here after doing a search, so I want to see what people think.

Even though I like nerdarchy's approach, it still seems overpowered. I had some thoughts about ways to tweak it to make it a bit more balanced, but it might still be too powerful even after my suggestions. Tell me what you think (these are just changes for level 3-5, I haven't given much thought to 6+ yet)

#Change stance
A monk can meditate and attune themselves to an element after a short or long rest. Changing a stance while adventuring or in combat costs 2 ki points and an action.

#Stance of Earth
The monk grounds themselves to the earth. If a player does not voluntarily move any distance during a turn, and if they do not pick either of their feet up from the ground, at the *end* of their turn they get a +2 to AC and cannot be knocked down, pushed, pulled, or picked up. This effect remains in place until the player picks one of their feet up for any reason, moves at least 1 foot in any direction, or changes stances. 

#Stance of Fire
Unarmed strikes are fire damage, and can extend 15 feet from the player's limbs if the player chooses. Because of the longer distance, an enemy has more time to react to the attack; The attack is at a disadvantage.

#Stance of water
The player can create a thin cocoon of water around them. The refraction from the water makes the monk harder to hit. Add your Wisdom modifier to your roll for Deflect Missiles. A missile cannot be caught in this way.

 #Stance of air
The player can make an unarmed strike to a flying enemy within a 15 foot cube of the player at a disadvantage",1

DnD,taway42742,1,"[5e] [Online] Atypical DND in an atypical setting!  

me and a couple of friends have decided to do DND! we're all literate, mature roleplayers. we're doing a text-based thing in a unique world i've built, featuring low-magic, realistic civilizations, and a cool ass map. we need two more players! (if i denied you before, go ahead and DM me again!)

before i continue, there's a few criteria:

* due to it being a persistent text-based thing, you should be able to be **active on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 8 PM central time.**
* **US timezones**! all our players are in there
* again, since it's a text-based thing, you should be able to **write and roleplay well**; this is way less gamey and more RP-y, so your character's personality will take priority over his stats or weapons

this is pretty atypical DND; there's no orcs, elves, dwarves, or crypts full of skeletons with shining swords at the end. the world is a bronze age archipelago developing after the fall of a modern civilization for unknown reasons - maybe you'll be a warrior from the Pangan Kingdom, who reverently worships the metal eye in the sky (an inactive satellite) or abhors the cursed burial grounds (landmine fields). the world is deeply built to allow for interacting cultures, strict religions, and multiple races.

however, there is magic, but it is incredibly rare. the **magic system is homebrewed** and developed to allow for a tonnn of creativity! you will definitely be able to use it, don't worry - and the amount of spells is only limited by how many you can come up with.

[https://i.imgur.com/8AN8BA0.png](https://i.imgur.com/8AN8BA0.png) a sneak peek at the map! you CAN explore this, it's sandboxy! there's a bunch of different cultures, ruins, interesting figures, religions, nations... magical landmarks, toxic wastelands, etc.

DnD,Yonnihwiy,0,"The Beginings of Yaru 'The Unlucky' I've been wanting to play a kobold for the longest time, but my previous DM banned all ""lizardy"" races (dragonborn, kobold, lizardfolk, yanti, tortle, ect.). I've since quit his campaign due to internal issues and decided to make a kobold for my new DMs game; I thought it would be fun to share what I came up with. The game is very roleplay heavy.
 Yaru is a level 3 astral guardian barbarian and level 2 fighter that I made to join their ongoing campaign.

Yaru was a cleaning servant for the Azious family, the areas ruling kobold family. He lived within the families small slave village just outside the royal palace, giving the wages he earned to his mother hoping to eventually earn her a way to freedom. Many in the village saw Yaru as a savior, often giving him small trinkets and other (usually handmade) gifts to show their appreciation. 
From the age of 8 to the age of 22 he tried his best to saved his measly paychecks, though the young princes of the family often would steal the money he was given, beating him nearly every chance they got. After informing his superiors of the events the boys were scolded for their stealing, though he was never given any of the stolen money back or ever treated for his injuries. 
By the time of Yaru's 22nd birthday, he had saved up just barely enough to pay for his now elderly mothers freedom. He had arranged, with his superior, a  ""speaking"" to the king (a meeting where a lower ranking individual has a higher up speak for them, having them adjust the conversation to be more formal for royalty or other high ranking individuals). After a short conversation, a payment of 600 gold pieces and the signing of a contract, the King agreed to have someone sent to set his mother free.
A great cheer could be heard all throughout the small village upon Yaru's return, many giving him small bits of their rations as gifts. Yaru, after spending a small amount of time with his friends and neighbors within the village, he sprinted home excited to see the great smile he knew his mother to have. 
His arrival was met not with the joy he had expected to feel, his mothers crumpled and bloodied body laid lifeless on their homes dirt floor, her blood pooling under her abused corpse. Above her body stood two kolbolds dressed in royal knights armor, each spewing cruel and crude jokes about the elderly kolbold woman. Yaru couldn't help but stare, his mind spinning faster each second. He managed to move his eyes to the two figures standing above his mother, before his mind went blank with rage. The two above his mother were the two young princes dressed in their knights garb, their swords and armor covered is excessive amounts of blood. 
Yaru's rage led him to beat the boys to near death, before dragging their beaten and bloodied bodies to his superiors home, leaving them there and running off into the woods.


This isn't all i have about Yaru, but I feel that my poor writing ability would not do justice to his character. 

Tell me what you all think, I'd love to improve his story before my first session. All the other players seem to have rather deep backstories for their characters and I want to bring something interesting to the table.",1
DnD,ickda,2,WIND ROSE - Diggy Diggy Hole (Official Video) | Napalm Records nan,1
DnD,mathayles,6,"Build a Better Backstory with Knives, Keys, Chains and Castles I think a lot of people by now are familiar with the idea of Knives‚Äîan aspect of your backstory you craft lovingly and hand to the GM to stab you with. Intentionally building backstory for the GM and other players to engage with is a really important player skill! But recently I‚Äôve been thinking about all the other ways of engaging backstory that aren‚Äôt sharp and pointy.

So I‚Äôve started to sketch out this incomplete list of concepts, and I‚Äôd love to know what is/isn‚Äôt resonating.

* Knives are to stab you with. This gives  the DM permission to mess with you. This is the stuff of sudden but inevitable betrayals, grisly revelations, and just good old fashioned endangerment. If you make your father a knife, he‚Äôll eventually turn on you, or reveal himself to be the bad guy, or he‚Äôll put himself in danger and you‚Äôll need to rescue him, or he‚Äôll do something else to harm your character.
* Keys open new opportunity, when you choose to use them. This tells the GM you‚Äôre interested in exploring X, but at your leisure. A letter of introduction to a noble opens up courtly intrigue. A map to buried treasure. A clue to the location of your lost sister. An unopened letter from a dead uncle. The deed to a castle on the other side of the Great Sea. A membership in a thieve‚Äôs guild. Etc.
* Chains tie you to people, places or things over time. This tells the GM and table you‚Äôre interested in exploring X repeatedly. The classic example is two players deciding their heroes are siblings. But this can also be obligations that intrude or constrain your character‚Äôs life: a membership in a thieve‚Äôs guild you‚Äôre not allowed to leave, and they give you jobs you‚Äôre not allowed to refuse. If you make your family‚Äôs lands in the shire a Chain, it tells the table you want to mostly stick to the local area. Did you swear to avenge your Master by slaying the Seven Lords of the Rataka Clan who burned his temple? That‚Äôs a Chain.
* Castles are safe spaces, the opposite of a knife. This tells the GM that you don‚Äôt want something to be threatened or dangerous. When you make your parents a Castle, it means you always have a safe space for your character to retreat to from the world. If you make your lover a Castle, they‚Äôll always be there for you. If you make the group of orphans you‚Äôve sworn to protect a Castle, they‚Äôll never be in any real danger.

What does everyone here think of this? Does it make sense? Would it help your table? Are there obvious holes you‚Äôd poke in it? Maybe others have done this work before, or better? Let me know what you think, please.",1

DnD,RadionRed,14,"True Polymorph and Antimagic Field I had a question about Antimagic Field and how it interacts with True Polymorph.

The current phrasing that I'm looking at (at least what I believe to be the current phrasing) for TP is:

&gt;If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.

Antimagic Field says:

&gt;Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

Whether or not the magic is ""active"" is up to the DM.

My question is that Antimagic Field says it ""*suppresses*"" and TP says ""lasts until *dispelled*"". Is this a case of specific rule overrides the general rule? That is generally AMF suppresses all magic, but specifically TP can only be dispelled, not suppressed?

Some of my searches have turned up that the spell stays but the transformation is suppressed. But the wording of TP specifically says ""the *transformation* lasts"", not the spell lasts. Am I reading that wrong?

Before I get into the features a little update for our iPhone users. Work is coming along on the iOS version and will be released hopefully in the next week or two. Ran into some issues with Apple and not having any apple products myself testing is harder. However, I broke down and ordered a used Mac Mini to finish up the iOS programming on so once that arrives later this week I can buckle down and get the iOS version launched. Now for the Features‚Ä¶

Scryer is a new location based (primary method) app designed like a dating app but instead of finding you a date, it finds you either a GM or players for your next Tabletop RPG group. It was designed to be simple and straight forward to filter out based on your preferences. Here are some of the features built into the app:

* Profile Creation that lets you specify what you are looking for in a game with preferences  

   * Age, Game Type, Freq, Campaign Length, GM/Player Experience, Homebrew, Location, Max Distance, Party Roles, Timezone, Play Type (RP vs Battle vs Puzzle), software used, Character Level
* Filters Profiles based on the following  

   * Game Type
   * Location (or time zone for those who want a broader search)
   * Player/GM Experience
   * Meeting Type (Online or In-Person)
   * Age
* Built in Chat system  

   * No Need to give out personal info until ready to join, chat and coordinate right in the app
* Easily switch between a GM or a Player profile to find multiple Groups

An issue with a player here. I should preface this by saying that this player isn't bad. He's not a terrible player and I enjoy DMing for him (I guess I enjoy DMing for anyone, though). 

Basically, this guy, let's call him John, has been playing D&amp;D for a really long time, and he LOVES reading the books. That's great, he's invested, etc. However, the kind of thing that happens... well, I'll give you an example, it will do justice more than explaining it.

DM: You creep quietly along the stone ledge, hearing drips of water echo throughout the cave. Finally, you see it. Its head is purple and smooth, and-

John: Mind Flayer! Oh my God you guys it's a Mind Flayer!

Or:

DM: The floor, you notice... there's something off. There is almost a slight glisten to-

John: Gelatinous Cube! Holy hell, I know these things, they're transparent, we have to...

(In both of these scenarios, he could be playing a character with very low knowledge of the world's monsters.)

I think I have a solution, but maybe it's not a good one. I thought I might change the design of some of D&amp;D's most famous monsters, like making a Mind Flayer red with tentacles coming out of its chest, or something like that. If you think this is a good idea, does anyone have any alt designs for Mind Flayers, Gelatinous Cubes, Beholders, etc?

If not, do you have any advice on how to deal with this? Any help is appreciated.

DnD,BebopAndHomesteady,3,"Can a creature ignore fancy footwork and get off an attack of opportunity? Is there something in the rules that would allow an enemy to ignore fancy footwork and get off an attack of opportunity?  Maybe a certain type of enemy or a certain feat or something like that?

Basically, I may have accidentally awakened a giant undead something because the boss we were fighting had absolutely no reaction to my fairly large damage attack and then got off an attack of opportunity on me.

We‚Äôve been playing for a year basically and since I got Fancy Footwork this is the first time anything has got an attack of opportunity off on me.  The whole thing seemed off to me.  

So I started thinking that this creature was something different, like a puppet being controlled remotely or something, so I tried to open this really big ominous door looking for the man behind the curtain.  But all we heard was the sound of stone grinding against stone, like the tomb door was starting to open or something.  And that was the end of the session.

So obviously everyone is mad at me for probably making the fight harder, but my tact changed on that opportunity attack. 

So I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs some home brew thing, just a mistake by the DM who may have been distracted at the time.  Or if there is clearly a rule that would allow something to ignore fancy footwork and I should have known better.

Thanks!",1

DnD,TylerJWhit,4,"LMoP Improvement A group of friends and I are starting our first D&amp;D Campaign where I'll be DM'ing. I've been doing a lot of research and heard that the Lost Mines of Phandelver has somewhat of a letdown of a boss (Nezznar).

In hopes of adding a more memorable boss, I was hoping to have a Level 2 Druid child who has a charmed Giant Spider. The kid won't do much fighting but will be mainly using the Spider to fight. 

The kid wants to see the town of Phandalin burned to ashes for killing his father, a priest. The town killed the priest after wrongfully accusing him of a heinous crime.

I feel like this gives a real threat for the PC's to face as the villain has a malicious motivation for the Forge of Spells as well as control over dangerous Monsters. 

Depending on how this plays out, I may have this child have a redeemed storyline (maybe have a retired PC or an NPC raise the child and have some magical curse/blessing from the attempted use of the forge).",1

DnD,bloodangelmaster,2,"[game tales] my first dnd session as a player so context, my brother made a small campaign for me to play so i can try being a player. i played as a half elf warlock with a companion black bear. (bear in mind there is some homebrew rules applied to the campaign)

the story is that i was asked to help out with the elven kingdoms problem of their bears (there wildly popular to elfs) are going on rampages then all of a sudden die. on my way to the kingdom i find an Aaracockra in the city guard armour telling me to pay to get in, immediately he was sketchy as we were still quite far from the city and only elves and halflings live by the city, i did an investigation check to find he wasn't a city guard, now being a chaotic neutral with a bear and eldritch blast lets just say i didn't pay him, i eventually got to the front gate and was let in, i went to the tavern to try haggle my way to try get some free stuff, then a brown bear barges in the room and a elf following behind it trying to calm it, i managed to incapacitate him and got a discount saving the tavern, win win. another ruckus was stirring outside the tavern except this time it was a awakened shrub and a animated knife, i got my bear to deal with him i searched around the place to find a sorcerer was controlling them, i chased him and called my black bear over (who managed to kill the shrub and the knife to being animated) 


as i chased him i kept seeing more and more almarajes, in my brothers campaign almarajes love helping adventures and can speak most languages, so i got one to help me chase the sorcerer who managed to conjure a shield around him, i got the almaraj who i named the helper to burst it, the sorcerer tried to protect himself but casting a spell but i turned to wild magic turning him into a sheep for and hour, grabbed him and took him to the guards and convinced them he was a sorcerer and went to the tavern and accidently got the almaraje drunk.

DnD,The21stJoker,19,"Gnome Battle Smith Ideas? Hello there, I'm new to DnD 5e (mostly just played pathfinder before) And I made a gnome battle smith (or he will be since we are starting at level 1) My whole thing is going to be a ranged character/healer who tinkers and attempts to improve weaponry, craft new weapons and repair. 

A little about my campaign to begin. It's meant to be drop-in/drop-out where those that can make it that day are the characters in that session and the ones that can't are sidelined for that session. To that effect, DM is implementing a mile-stone level system where we level after hitting certain points. 

The world is also Steam/dieselpunk and is set on a series of islands with a vortex in the center. We are adventurers/privateers contracted by the ruling theocratic government to explore and record what we see since islands just pop into existence from time to time meaning cartography and cultural expeditions are a very lucrative business. 

Our ship itself is mainly operated by sails but in a pinch, we have an engine consisting of a contained, but very angry, fire elemental that we drench in water to produce steam.

What I want to do is improve this ship, create fun inventions (I'm proficient in tinker, smith, and wood making tools with carpentry most likely to come next)  And not necessarily have them be combat inventions but quirky trinkets and QoL inventions. Though i won't say no to a fun way to make a canon. 

So, any ideas of how to use these tools and magical tinkering in just fun ways? So far my DM has given me a large cube of metal that seems to melt anything it touches (it damaged my dagger and straight-up melted a ball bearing) but it is held on cloth covered in symbols from a cult of fire that we took down in the first session. My idea is to try and craft this into a weapon of some kind (maybe a dagger or even crossbow bolts) by analyzing and carving the symbol into a hilt and scabbard or onto the bolt shafts and crossbow to make melta-bolts.

Any other fun ideas in general for my gnome? Thanks!",1

That's what you *could* do. But where's the fun in that? The inn isn't a Pokemon Center, after all.

I like to make my inns and taverns as evocative and memorable for my players as anything else in my game. Sometimes, that means making the accommodations suboptimal, conditional, or just plain strange.

I am trying to design an adventure around Acquisitions Inc and Eberron Rising where the players become part of one of the Houses and have to compete against the other Houses in order to create a business successful enough to gain the King's Seal. From there, they are thrown a big event inducting them into the fold, which is when they are going to try and steal the King's Crown since its made of an ancient magical artifact that is slowly destroying him and the world.

The problem I'm currently running into is exactly HOW to do the business side of things that feels fun and not a slog. I don't mind it having some sort of basic resource management stuff, but I still want each task to involve some sort of encounter or mini adventure. Like getting a new supply route involves them having to go clear out a cave or save a town, that sort of thing.  
I don't know what type of business they are going to decide on yet, so its hard to prep TOO many details, but I want to get the structure down.

Here's my notes so far, maybe you guys got some ideas...

**Plot Hook:**

Ten years ago, a new leader came to power in Farroway: a man named Stanley Hadwick. He once was a traveling salesman that was beloved by the community until one day, he discovered an artifact of incredible power. His business began to instantly flourish as clones of himself began popping up everywhere and steamrolling the local businesses with cheap knockoffs. They were dubbed ‚ÄúThe Stans‚Äù by the populus. He established himself as King Stanley and turned the whole country into a tourist destination for idiots seeking gold and glory. The 12 Houses that once held power in the land have had to change how they do business in order to survive. Some have thrived while others have crumbled. Stanley has created the House of Stan, which is considered a usurper House by all the other factions that have been around for centuries. There appears to be no clear way to oust King Stanley in open turf wars, assassination, or even full blown seiges. Many Houses have tried and felt the iron fist of House Stan. House Tharashk, The Finder‚Äôs Guild, has finally located the source of King Stanley‚Äôs powers - a mystical artifact called The Orrery of the Wanderer - and seeks to steal or destroy it. Unfortunately the only way to do that is to gain access to the Vault, deep in the Castle of Glory. This means that a heist is in order of a grand scale, but first, the House must regain its status. Whenever a House establishes itself with the Castle of Glory, a grand event is thrown in their honor. During these events, they have learned that King Stanley stashes his crown in the vault and swaps it with a duplicate. This is the time that it will need to be taken. A House needs to accumulate a total of 1,000,000 gold coins in order to purchase its ranking from the King. Other Houses are also trying to get the coveted position, so they will try and stop you. Even the Houses who have already obtained the Seal will try and cut down the other Houses to eliminate competition. Rival Houses are outfitted with varying levels of advanced transportation streams and heavy weaponry to protect their various businesses. Everything from air balloons with energy cannons to giant statues that can smash buildings. Once the Seal of the King has been gained, the heist planning can begin. The objective is to get in and out with the artifact without getting caught. Anyone caught will be executed at Dawn by the Stans. Do you have what it takes to climb to the top of the ladder, gain entry into the Castle of Glory, and steal the artifact of power? Let the Heist of the Mad Plaid King begin.

**Big Business Competition:**

There were 12 Houses originally in power in Farroway and this is their current status in the kingdom:

**Low Tier influence:**

**Medani (Detection)**: Bleeding heart activists in the risk assessment game. Direct competition with House Tharashk and House Deneith.

**Tharashk (Finding)**: Considered out of the game in the region.

**Ghallanda (Hospitality)**: Inns, bars, and entertainment masters.

**Lyrandar (Storm)**: Focusing on its Zuza home base.

**Phiarlan (Shadow)**: Most resources have been pulled out of the region.

**Mid Tier influence. Vying for a King‚Äôs Seal:**

**Vadalis (Handling)**: Butchery and beistary for mounts and meats.

**Kundarak (Warding)**: Bankers and vault extraordinaires.

**Sivis (Scribing)**: Communications experts.

**Deneith (Sentinel)**: Direct rival of House Tharashk and main source of bodyguard labor in the area.

**High Tier influence. King‚Äôs Seal Acquired:**

**Orien (Passage)**: A neutral House in the region that supplies transportation to all.

**Jorasco (Healing)**: A neutral House in the religion that supplies healing and medicine to the other Houses.

**Cannith (Making)**: One of the heaviest influencers in the nation.

**Basics of Business Management:**

You have a daily amount of both Cost from incoming resources and Gain from outgoing products or services. Each shipment of each counts as one unit and you can only supply as many goods/services as you have raw resource bundles.

**Bounty Board Options:**

New Supply Chain: Increase your amount of incoming resources by 1 through acquiring a new source of raw materials.

New Partner: Increase your amount of available output by acquiring a new investor to use or sell your goods/services in a wider market.

Transportation Upgrade: Gain an upgrade for the transportation of your supply chain and investors to improve the speed and quantity of goods and services delivered. This effectively halves the cost of incoming resources.

Goods/Services Upgrade: Create a new product of an increased tier to put through your supply chain and investor markets.",1

To continue on, the players had lost an NPC in the first arena battle. They played out the aftermath in the cell, this including one of the other NPCs morning the loss of his brother. They tried to escape and to see if there was something in the cell they could use. The main reason they didn't get out, because the DM said so. They were on a boat and really could not go anywhere.

The next day, they were forced into another arena fight. Lost another NPC in the battle (this was scripted to happen). The NPC tried to strike back at the captors and it didn't end well. This escalated things the boat as the main villian was now getting angry for losing slaves. He knocks them unconcious with a poison gas. One player tried to hold his breath. I gave him some leeway and he was able to get a door unlocked, but due to a failed CON check, eventually passed out.

They are awoken the next day by the Villian and are threatened to not try anything. As he is talking, the boat is rammed by another one. Villian runs out to see what happens. I gave the players the freedom to try and escape, all the while it sounded like a battle was going on upstairs. After a little bit of trying, their saviours came and got them out of the cell. I really built up the sense of hopelessness before the rescue. They go to the deck of the ship and are faced by the Villian and a white dragon. Since level 1 chars would be wiped out, I had two Metalic dragons come in and save them. The party and good NPCs escape to the saviours ship. They now find out rhey are in Icewind Dale, very far from home. 

The saviours let them know they have been intercepting slave ships and that there has been an increase in their appearance. The Metalic dragons return and take humanoid shape. They inform the party that a war of dragons is coming. That they are trying to stop the chromatic dragons from gaining more power. The players agreed to help in the north. They get sent to a shop owner to get outfitted so they can continue adventuring. The prologue ended off the players sitting at the inn and looking at each other. They had been through something traumatic, but knew they could trust each other. The whole point of the prolgue, to bond the players in a different way.

One additional fun fact. The shop owner is the first character I ever made. He was based in Icewind Dale when I played him in 2nd edition. Now, he is 25 years older and an NPC. The savior party was made up of other characters that my fiends played with me. It was nice revisiting those old memories and helping those characters live on.

My plan now is to have more modular adventures inside a greater storyline. As sometimes people can't make it to the game, this will allow them to sit out, but still progress the story. Which is going to be a fight against a white dragon cult. I am going to have them find pieces of information on where to find the main enemy camp, but not until they are higher level. The dragon war will be fought on various fronts all over Faerun, but this part will focus on the north. Looking forward to the next steps.",1

I decided early on I wanted to try my hand at a heavy role playing character and selected to be a bard. Early on the plan was to do point buy or standard, but one of the players lobbied for rolled stats and this just got me overly nervous. We all worked through the rolling and low and behold my character didn't roll anything above a 14. While there was a lower cap I just barely squeaked above it.  Several of the other players are starting of with an 18 or two 2 18s, and my highest stat is a 16.  As a bard where so much is tied to charisma i cant help but feel mechanically weak, I was hoping for an 18 in chrisma so I could take level 4 insperational leader, but now feel like such a step is wrong.  On top of that my character doesn't really have any low stats so I can't really act out any good flaws beyond backstory vices.

I want to roleplay with this alot so the stats aren't a big deal, but in such a large group I can't help but feel like I'm a burden.  My chances to hit are lower, my spell save dc is lower, my AC is lower, my hp is lower.

If anyone has advice or good stories about similar instance that would be great. I'm trying to stay positive, but this already as killed any chance I DM a rolled stats campaign in the future unless we were to meet up and every use the same set of rolled stats.",1

A 6th Level spell is SUPPOSE to be good, so okay, but it's hardly mouth watering. It takes a 6th level spell slot, so for most classes this is a 11th level ability. It's in the save or suck category, meaning a savings throw completely negates it. My Twinned Eldritch blast Sorlock or action surged (2 level fighter dip) does near the same damage minus the vaporizing the  target part. Um  Really? 10D6 + 40 with a generous average is 80 IF &amp; only IF the save is failed. While 6d10 + 30 (agonizing eldritch blast w/same average calculation) is 66 with no save. A 14 point damage difference at that level means little. Yes I understand that you might miss with a blast or 2 but that is easily offset by a creature has to FAIL a dex save for Disintegrate to do any damage (Hello Legendary resistances) Not to mention if I'm the big bad (DM) I'm not wasting a Counterspell on a cantrip compared to everytime I can I will try to make someone lose a 6th level spell slot! As a matter of fact a lot of spells can be up cast to rival the damage, looking at you Fireball.

DnD,SOJI-KUN,4,"Need help with my character! I'm a beginner Hey, everyone.  
My best friend has been trying to get me into DnD for a while now, and I was finally convinced after playing a bit of Fire Emblem which gave me a lot of inspiration for a character that I thought would be fun.  


Problem is, I do not know how to distribute my stats for my character, how important each skill is for my chosen class and race (Tiefling Order of the Lycan Blood Hunter), and what would make sense for the theme I'm going for.  


His current random stats are 12 STR, 12 DEX, 13 CON, 13 INT, 11 WIS, 10 CHA and I have four more skill points to spend. I know STR and INT are really good for him but idk how to use all four points efficiently for him. Odd numbers have no point from what I've heard.  


I'm taking heavy inspiration from ""Fallen Male Corrin"" from Fire Emblem Heroes' physical appearance (you should look up his voice lines for context, as it may help you help me figure out what to do here), and the Hunter from Bloodborne's fighting style. My Tiefling's personality is going to be a lot more different, but his fighting style would be similar to how the Hunter or the Chosen Undead use Great Swords.  


My Tiefling is a lone mercenary as not many people trust Blood Hunters, OR Tieflings (from what I've heard), so he just sits somewhere around town, polishing and cleaning his weapons, sort of like ""advertising himself"" as a reliable and careful fighter so that people would maybe offer him jobs to take if they see past his intimidating demeanor. He's actually a very gentle and selfless person who just wants to be treated the same as everyone else, and can even be quite the romantic/romanticist when he feels completely open with himself (or if he's drunk and around a person he's interested in, or just women in general), as he tends to enjoy escaping from reality by reading books of brave heroes where they defeat the dastardly villain, and rescue their love interest.  
However, due to the circumstances of his birth and class, he has no choice but to kinda mask his true personality as not many people would actually trust him if he were to act all like that. They would think it's just an act. So, ironically, he has to make an act that he's really a dark and brooding person to hide his true personality, so that people wouldn't find him untrustworthy for acting like a unusually friendly Tiefling.  
Because of this, he's quite sad, but once the party recruits him, I'm planning to make him really pleasantly surprised that someone would actually want him to travel with them, show off his true personality for a moment but then catching himself and going back to how his ""alter-ego"" is.

I mean by exemple : 
Zombie Guy gas 2 hit points left. It takes a hit that does 7 damages, bringing its hit points at 0 (and under) for the first time.
Its DD to reach with Undeaad Fortitude is 5+7 with in Fortitude. It manages and is back at 1 HP.

Next turn it takes 6 damages.
Does its DD is 5+6=11. Or does it's becomes 5+7+6=18 ?

My druid is a very versatile character who goes with whatever is happening that day. Buffing, scouting, fighting, whatever. He is a forest circle who likes to get his hands dirty, be a fluffy bunny, burn things, and do some minor healing (we have a life cleric, but he also likes to not only ever do one thing).

I was thinking of multiclassing as monk soonish for the AC bump and extra mobility on the field. I'm thinking that as the other characters get more into fighting my druid will be running around casting AOE field control spells and taking out minions/healing party members (that level 3 way of mercy healing looks nice). 

Another thought was that unarmed strike may or may not work in wildshape? I haven't found a concrete answer in any forums I've checked. Yes any fighting animal will have hooves or bite stronger than a d4, but could flurry of blows still be used by a giant spider, for example? 

I have a lot of time to make this choice as it needs to wait at least until after the next level up (need a spell for a plot thing). So any thoughts or references to things I can look up would be very helpful.

DnD,ShadowAtiriya,0,"I did not originally plan to have my Druid join the party full time XD Context is DM customized a quest for Lost Mines Of Phandelver(I think or Sunless Citadel) where instead of NPC druid needing help clearing out a group of cultists from a forest, my DM let that druid be my Druid who is selfnamed(not her birthname) Fae. also this is from several months ago before our barbarian joined so my memory isn't the best but I'm trying XD

So, this was just originally so I could play one of my various other characters I made cuz I at the time wasn't sure if I could run two characters(I can now) and the DM let me test drive that with bringing in my druid for this quest.

Fae is an old friend of my Monk, which was the hook used to get the party there as she asked my monk for help protecting the forest of a fellow druid she happened to know and was, at the time of writing, on her way there already as she had her magic familiar deliver the letter.

We get there, we help her, we end up killing the cult and driving the dragon they were worshiping away, and by this point after all the loot and such was divided and we told a npc who lived in the forest what we did, we began to wonder about Fae.

I ORIGINALLY planned on just having her go back to her forest and continuing on just playing my Monk alone. But I did not expect to get attached to playing her and how chaotically fun she is to play XD

I think our sorcerer got attached to her a lot as well, our fighter didn't have much of an opinion on her, especially with how Fae REALLY DID NOT LIKE THE DROW(hypocrite of her as she's a quarter-drow high elf x'D) and actually tried to get the drow caught in her call lightning at one point but the dm allowed the pcs aside from her to react and run for the hills XD

But eventually I decided to leave it up to the dice, as Fae and my Monk were talking and monk was trying to persuade her to stay/come with while Fae was grimacing and going ""no I want to go back to my forest!"". So I had monk at advantage and Fae at disadvantage(Fae has soft spot for Monk, huge soft spot she'll never ever tell anyone about).

Monk got a 12 to Fae's 4 XD And Fae ALREADY ROLLED REALLY BAD as she had the 4 and a 6, Monk had a 5 and 12 XD

So reluctant Druid stuck around and I actually play her a lot more than monk though I try to balance them when roll playing them in rp stuff XD

Fae still doesn't like the fighter though.

That's not ever going to change even if she's not casting spells towards the drow anymore, got webbed at one point by our sorcerer because they were fighting during Heist of Waterdeep I think XD",1

I love anything to do with d&amp;d but generally lack groups to play with, just me being antisocial and that, but when quarantine happened I was in discord with my brothers friends who played together at his college and we decided to start up some online d&amp;d, which I am DMing, I‚Äôve played a very small amount with these people before and I know them relatively well out of d&amp;d, so I was hoping to just have some fun stories to run with them and see how things go. For simplicity for everyone during quarantine we decided to not do a home brew setting, so we are doing this campaign in Eberron, and are three sessions in now, but I‚Äôve been having an issue where the players get annoyed with each other really easily out of character, and these annoyances always turn into arguments that are ‚Äúin character‚Äù but really just them ranting at each other, I try to break tension and cool everybody off but it tends to weigh on the group for the rest of that session. And it‚Äôs at a point in which any encounter that involves any amount of role play immediately turns into a player argument, this with the fact that one of the players isn‚Äôt really all that into d&amp;d but wants to play for me makes me wonder if I even should continue to run it. Last week I told myself I would tell them that I was considering stopping it but then I got more inspiration for future plots and characters and I couldn‚Äôt stop myself with all the world building, so does anyone have any advice for how I might reduce tensions in game to keep from igniting these sparks between players? I‚Äôd really like to salvage this if I can but I‚Äôm lost at this point.

DnD,F0rtesque,2,"Who wants to create a fantasy species?  Hey fellow people of the nerdy persuasion,

I'm  fairly new to reddit. I'm dm'ing a campaign that will have the  characters go to a plane of existence where they (along with other  individuals) will be the gods of creation, forming the landmass, placing  mountains and woods  etc. and each create a species that populates the  continent. I need NPC species and originally wanted to create them. But  after three people (who aren't part of the p&amp;p group) created  species as well I though maybe it'd be cool if a lot of species come  from the people of the internet.

First, you can choose a name and appearance for the species. Then you choose the reproduction rate. There is:

1 (rare) = 20 points on stats

2 (average) = 16  points on stats

3 (rabbits) = 12 points on stats

Next,  you can spend your points on the 5 stats. Stat minimum is 0, maximum is  4 (rabbits), 5 (average) and 6 (rare). The stats are:

Body, Dexterity, Society, Magic and Culture.

Each point in a stat creates a focus point to put into the three sub-stats each. There are:

Body (Strength, Lifespan, Resistance)

Dexterity (Agility, Artisanry, Architecture)

Society (Charme, Trade, Solidarity)

Magic (Environment, Body, Mind)

Culture (Religion, Law, Art)

For  example, if the species of the ""Kulpit"" chose Body 4, they have 4 focus  points to distribute. They go with Body 4 (Strength 7, Lifespan 4,  Resistance 5).

The species will be  put on the continent at about an iron age to antiquity level of  technology, will interact with each other and with the player species  (the player species won't have an edge over the NPC ones by default. The  players also won't have perfect control over their species (depending  on cohesion) and the species will fracture, migrate, mingle and trade.

Alright, I'll be thankful for anyone who comments and creates a species. Cheers!",1

The initial ability scores can be 11 13 10 16 18 08 since the level 6 utility serpent's cunning gives + 1 on intelligence attacks for the entire day but you won't be able to take the second skin feat (+2 AC) in epic.

This build takes advantage of the artificer's arcane empowerment class feature to reuse your best items daily powers. You will be using a bow for the artificer weapon attacks and a Ki Focus as an implement. At level 4 you get access to the screaming bow, which converts neutral damage to thunder while the lvl 9 thunderfist ki focus turns your melee damage into thunder. The artificer has plenty of weapon attacks that deal untyped damage and the Druid's summons mostly have melee attacks, so you will be dealing thunder damage on 90% of your attacks.

This combos nicely with the genasi's racial power that gives you 1d8 per tier extra damage on a hit with lightning/thunder attacks and the Screaming bow's daily power gives 10/15/20 thunder vulnerability to one enemy + 5 vulnerability to those adjacent to it. If you take a second screaming bow (even if it has to be one level lower), you get four uses of it's daily power per day, as you can use arcane empowerment to refill each of them once.

The artificer has several multi attack and off turn encounter powers while the druid has much better offensive dailies, forming a nice balance since heroic. The recomended paragon path is traveler's harlequin because it allows you to have multiple class specific multiclass feats and even gives you one for free. Using it for MC avenger gives you one use of oath of enmity per encounter (useful for your summons melee attacks), access to holy symbols and the pervasive light feat (If your team has a morninglord distributing radiant vulnerability left and right). 

The Symbol of victory daily power gives you an action point when you crit and you can reuse it once thanks to arcane empowerment. That's 4 to 5 APs per day (or 6 with solitaire violet starting at level 26, but that's overkill) or one AP per encounter. The cipher theme lets you use two of those per encounter once a day, which you can do by simply not using an AP for one encounter. After you already activeted the symbol of victory twice, you could wear a symbol of divine light to increase radiant vulnerabilty on enemies.

The MC swordmage is there for power swapping a lvl 16 utility for borrowed confidence. an encounter itulity that let's you roll twice for all attacks until the start of your next turn. It greatly increases your accuracy on nova turns and helps in getting those crits for activating symbol of victory/solitaire violet even without expanded crit range. IF you have a bard/warlord/someone that gives you huge bonuses to hit, you can skip the MC swordmage and take other feats instead.

Traveler's harlequin also let's you choose your lvl 20 daily from all paragon paths you have access to or take a lvl 19 daily from one of your classes. I recommend the lvl 20 summon power from the Primal Summoner paragon path (PP). Things get crazy at level 21 when each of your action points give you 3 extra actions and you can use minor actions to make them attack. Also, the primal resurgence feat giives you an extra use of a primal daily power.

Assuming a 5 encounter day, you can use an artificer daily in one of them and one druid summon on each of the others. No action point for the encounter of the artificer daily, one on three others and two on a single encounter. AND you can create thunder vulnerability in 4 of those. Don't do it the encounter you summon the lightning drake, as you can't convert it's AOE damage to thunder (it still gets the extra damage from the genasi racial because it's lightning).

There's also a massive combo you can make with the writhing henge level 25 daily. You can check that on the original build from the link:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/gqkm8d/optimizing\_the\_master\_of\_moments\_epic\_destiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/gqkm8d/optimizing_the_master_of_moments_epic_destiny/)

DnD,deadghost316,10,"Can you help me pick an alignment for my character? I'm trying my hand on a Yaun-ti Rouge, but with a twist. Instead of being an evil, manipulative, sneaky killer, she's ambitious, cheerful, naive, open to new new things and slightly oblivious towards the dirty glares of the townfolks.

The idea is that when she was young, she met a wounded adventurer. Fearing for his life, he tried to contemplate with her while pleading for the life. The Yaun-ti, being easily impressionable, took interest in his work which eventually made her child-like mind fond of exploring the world rather than being another soldier in the tribe.

The reason why she's a Rouge is because she was, as aforementioned, trained to become an Assassin but later doubled down on her life in hopes of pursuing the life of an adventurer.

I'm not sure a lawful alignment is within her nature since she tends to be oblivious towards most of her action that might end up harming the bystanders or even her party. She wants to make friends along the way, and that might include the baddies later down the campaign. Staying true to her race, she lacks empathy and compassion so she wouldn't be phased if someone was beheaded in front of her. At most, she might be confused.

If you have an idea of what her character is about, what alignment do you think suits her the best. Also, if you think her background can use a little more polish I'm all ears.",1

The problem with this being that the city was supposed to be a rather for one character's plot development and the mission they had been sent on seems rushed and without much explanation.

What is your opinion on retconning the last hour of gameplay where the PCs talked to the Lord. Note, I don't want to take away the actions the players chose and want to preserve their choices to go to the city etc.

New DMs can join the server and immediately start up their new campaign by using our custom bot, The Chef, to create their category and role, and govern their campaign as they please. The server largely hosts D&amp;D 5e, however the player base is very open to new systems and homebrew - campaigns that use systems such as FATE, and Call of Cthulu have had (and are having!) success on the server.

So please, come and join us in the Tavern, whether you are a DM looking for players, seeking critique on their new homebrew, or a player wanting to join a campaign.

DnD,Xenon009,6,"Intelligence and Wisdom, What do they actually measure? In our real world, Intelligence is the measure of your capacity to learn, while Wisdom is a measure of what you know, But in DnD it seems to be quite different. For example, Nature, Religion, History and to an extent arcana are all a measure of a characters actual knowledge, rather than their ability to ""Put 2 and 2 together"" and Wisdom seems to be a measure of all the things that didn't really fit into the other categories, So with that I ask, what do you think Int and Wis actually measure in this game?

DnD,quill-of-doom,15,"I Feel Like I‚Äôm a Terrible Player First of all, I‚Äôd just like to apologise if this violates any rules or regulations. If so please just delete this.

To start off, I‚Äôm playing in a prewritten 5e campaign with some people I met over discord because of the whole pandemic thing. This campaign has 6 players, however I‚Äôm not going to go into detail in case one of them sees this post. 

To start off, I‚Äôm playing a race that I‚Äôve seen people call OP. It gets a lot of resistances and is really strong. When I asked the DM if I could play the race, he said that it was fine, since it was from an allowed source book, even after I double checked and told him it seemed really powerful.

I made my class a hexblade, which is also pretty strong. I was originally planning to play another caster but we needed another frontliner and this meant I could still cast some cool spells.

Pretty early into the game, I came across an overpowered weapon that an enemy dropped. This thing does some serious damage that basically gives me a rogue sneak attack whenever I hit with it. I made this my pact weapon as soon as possible because it was better than my lame axe. Even though I found out it was cursed (giving me vulnerability to necrotic) I still feel like I‚Äôm stepping on everyone‚Äôs toes by using it, since the other magic items we have are far less powerful.

And then in our most recent session I got an absolutely batshit insane ring. Taking the ring despite some obvious red flags earned me an alignment shift. I was given its stats as a whisper and it‚Äôs so strong. When I read it I was saying that it was super powerful and how awesome it was without disclosing what it did.  

And now I just feel really bad. Nobody else has any strong magic items and I‚Äôm just going to kill literally everything with my new stuff. I was already hogging the spotlight out damaging everyone and now I feel like I‚Äôm just min-maxing and hogging the spotlight.

Is there anyway to stop stepping on everyone‚Äôs toes? We just got a bunch of money and stuff, so I‚Äôm hoping my fellow adventurers can get some magic items from a shop or something when we reach the next big settlement.

But if that doesn‚Äôt happen, or if they don‚Äôt buy some strong magic items? I honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. 

I‚Äôm already really bad for talking over other players, and interrupting people. I even tried to attack the bad guy during his evil monologue because I was worried the ghost/projection of him was going to attack us, and the other players mentioned later that you should always let them monologue. Especially when we have little info.

How can I be a better player and team mate? I‚Äôm so worried that I‚Äôm ruining this game for everyone and nobody‚Äôs having fun because of me and I really just want to make sure everyone enjoys the DM‚Äôs hard work.",1

DnD,Guy-Person,3,"Yet 3 further game breaking and half-thought out D&amp;D magical items. Frank the indestructible hobo. An NPC who, for all intents and purposes, cannot under any normal circumstances have his max or current HP reduced by any amount. This also applies to degradation caused by age, starvation, thirst, or any disease from his current state. His physical form is that of a disheveled and emaciated man in tattered clothing. It is unknown how he got this condition, not how old he is, but he is willing to venture into some hostile environments for payment in the form of ale and a meal. He often speaks in slurred tones of how he was once a well respected and feared man, or how he once fought a forgotten god for love, but not one of his stories ever seems to contradict another. He is either an excellent liar when drunk, or and excellent liar when sober. Either way, he seems content now to live out eternity in poverty.

With some form of magnification (around 50x) will reveal that the writing is the transcription of every war strategy and battle tactic in all creation. This includes weapon designs, logistics, and espionage tactics. What is odd is that it constantly refers to battles from the future or wars not on this plane, as well as something called ‚Äúthe Last Conflict‚Äù that ends at the bottom corner of one side. It may even speak of the party that finds it and how they are strategically important.

DnD,Ganaham,9,"Should I take Elemental Adept? I'm currently playing a 2nd level tiefling fiend warlock in a campaign that is supposed to go to 20th level. I'm planning on becoming Pact of the Tome. 4th level is coming up, and I'm split between taking Elemental Adept (fire) or getting +2 to Cha, which is currently at 16. I'm planning to take most of the fire spells available to me and use them regularly, because I think it would be fun to base a character around an element and the first 9 levels of fiend warlock seem like they are supporting me in this area with the expanded spell list. If I do take the feat I'm absolutely doing it at 4th level and no later.

My concern is that Elemental Adept is going to be almost useless for the second half of the campaign, because I'm not going to get any new fire spells after I hit level 11 and upcasting spells can only do so much, especially with a limited number of spell slots. Also, Elemental Adept isn't a very powerful feat in most campaigns and I don't think this one will be an exception. I'll ask the DM if we can workshop it a little bit but I want to get advice from here before I bug him about it only to turn around and say I changed my mind.

I do not have enough experience with playing a warlock or playing in a 20th level campaign, so I'm asking for advice from people that do. If this was a typical 10 level campaign I'd take it in a heartbeat but the latter third of the Warlock spell list having no fire spells to work with has me nervous.

DnD,WhoMeNewMe,22,"Percent roll, 1-100 with a d10 and double digit d10 - Help! First, some clarifications:

1. In this post, I am specifically talking about the use of a d10 die, and a double digit d10 die (which from here on, I will be referring to as a percentile die)
2. Unless specific rules from whatever system you are using explicitly say, it is impossible to get a 0 - 100 system with the d10 and percentile dice (or two d10s)
3. There is no confusion when using a 0 - 99 system. You read the dice as is and the number you see is what you get
4. To reiterate: a lot of people use two d10s to represent percent. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT USING D10s. Specifically, I am using a d10 and the percentile die (00 - 90)

Now the methods: Method 1 - I call the wraparound method - is the traditional, and seemingly most common way to interpret these dice. Method 2 - I call the addition method - is the demonized method for being a little less intuitive although it is wholly consistent with how single d10s are used and not double dipping with the 00 value. I wrote out the roll table below so we can compare:

#### Method 1
|   | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 00  |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| **0** | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |
| **1** | 11 | 21 | 31 | 41 | 51 | 61 | 71 | 81 | 91 | 1   |
| **2** | 12 | 22 | 32 | 42 | 52 | 62 | 72 | 82 | 92 | 2   |
| **3** | 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 | 53 | 63 | 73 | 83 | 93 | 3   |
| **4** | 14 | 24 | 34 | 44 | 54 | 64 | 74 | 84 | 94 | 4   |
| **5** | 15 | 25 | 35 | 45 | 55 | 65 | 75 | 85 | 95 | 5   |
| **6** | 16 | 26 | 36 | 46 | 56 | 66 | 76 | 86 | 96 | 6   |
| **7** | 17 | 27 | 37 | 47 | 57 | 67 | 77 | 87 | 97 | 7   |
| **8** | 18 | 28 | 38 | 48 | 58 | 68 | 78 | 88 | 98 | 8   |
| **9** | 19 | 29 | 39 | 49 | 59 | 69 | 79 | 89 | 99 | 9   |

#### Method 2
|   | 00 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90  |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| **1** | 1  | 11 | 21 | 31 | 41 | 51 | 61 | 71 | 81 | 91  |
| **2** | 2  | 12 | 22 | 32 | 42 | 52 | 62 | 72 | 82 | 92  |
| **3** | 3  | 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 | 53 | 63 | 73 | 83 | 93  |
| **4** | 4  | 14 | 24 | 34 | 44 | 54 | 64 | 74 | 84 | 94  |
| **5** | 5  | 15 | 25 | 35 | 45 | 55 | 65 | 75 | 85 | 95  |
| **6** | 6  | 16 | 26 | 36 | 46 | 56 | 66 | 76 | 86 | 96  |
| **7** | 7  | 17 | 27 | 37 | 47 | 57 | 67 | 77 | 87 | 97  |
| **8** | 8  | 18 | 28 | 38 | 48 | 58 | 68 | 78 | 88 | 98  |
| **9** | 9  | 19 | 29 | 39 | 49 | 59 | 69 | 79 | 89 | 99  |
| **0** | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |

Now, I definitely get the appeal of method 1. Seeing a 00 and 0 roll makes people want it to be 100. It also adds to the drama of first rolling a 00, thinking you may get a low number, and then getting the 0 to make it 100. I also know that there is some holdover from using two d10s. The most convincing argument I've seen for this method is the intuition of using the percentile die as the 10s digit, and the d10 and the single digit. This way, a 50 and a 0 will be 50. However, this breaks the even more traditional way of reading a d10. Not to mention that using one value (00) to represent two numbers (0, and 100) is just inherently wrong.

In my mind, what makes the most sense is adding the two dice together. This means the dice will always be the same value and there is no double dipping of using 00 as 100 when you roll a 0 on the d10, and 0 when you roll anything else. That means d10 can mean what d10s have always meant - which is 1 through 10 with 0 being the 10. And then you add that number to the percentile die (00 - 90). This means a 1 (d10) + 0 (00 on percentile die) is always 1; a 2 (d10) + 30 (percentile) is always 32; and a 10 (d10) + 40 (percentile) is always 50. It might seem less intuitive reading the 0 and 40 as 50 by looking at the numbers, but it makes perfect sense when adding these dice together to get a value.

Can someone please help me make sense of this. Method 2 is the only consistent method, but most people I've seen trash it for inexplicable reasons.",1
DnD,felixrussia,10,"Moving on from a Character First off, sorry for the long post, please stick with me! TL;DR: not happy with the character I rolled because my party is ruining it for me, considering rolling a new one.

For a little context, the game I‚Äôm in just completed Chapter 1 and will be continuing in a few weeks. The DM for my game offered the chance for people that aren‚Äôt enjoying the game as much to drop out so that more people that are actually interested can join, but also the chance for people that aren‚Äôt connecting or as invested in their character to roll new ones at the same level as the ‚Äòretired‚Äô character.

I don‚Äôt want to drop out, but I‚Äôm very interested in rolling something new, but I‚Äôm also very torn. I worked with my DM to make sure that the backstory was allowed and worked well with the general story. I felt really good about my character going into the campaign, but some of the other players are making it less enjoyable. 

I rolled a cleric slightly because I knew heals would be necessary, especially since my DM worked in a gimmick of health potion ‚Äòpoisoning‚Äô essentially I‚Äôm guessing to encourage better teamwork and planning. However, I mostly rolled a cleric because I actually enjoy playing support classes/roles regardless of the game. 

I really want to continue developing my character and actually see what my DM is going to do in the story plot for further development, but at the same time, I want to have fun. I get that as the cleric, me and our paladin are going to be frontlining, but when our warlock is casting guidance unnecessarily and our wizard is casting cantrips or is in a different room altogether, I end up needing my spell slots for damaging enemies rather than heals and then have everyone yelling about why I don‚Äôt prepare heal spells for our sessions. It gets boring and tedious slogging through waves of chumps with a team that‚Äôs not paying attention. 

So I‚Äôm strongly considering rolling a new sheet that focuses just what I want. Has anyone been in a similar situation where they‚Äôd rather retire a character rather than continue developing their current one? Would love advice or even similar stories, just to know I‚Äôm not alone. Thanks for reading.",1

DnD,jaredkent,1,"Very First D&amp;D Campaign - Any Help with Dragonborn Bard Backstory? Hey guys! As the title implies, this is my very first D&amp;D campaign and tabletop RPG. I've been watching some campaigns on youtube here and there the past couple of years and with lockdown finally jumped in. I've always been interested in playing a bard as my first character and, well, chose the race that just seemed cool to me. Who doesn't want to be part dragon?

The thing is that my initial, shallow, backstory came easily but now that Session 1 has come and gone, I really want to dive deeper and start fleshing it out (as well as maybe some long term goals.) Would love suggestions and help from the more seasoned RPers on this subreddit.

Here's what I've got so far:

From the town of Rizeron in the desert nation of Pelakros. Due to it's close proximity to Schwartzwelt, Rizeron is a settlement that prides itself on raising and championing warriors to keep a vigilant watch against any possible demonic excursion. Exiled from his clan for being a bard. Because of this Khalugar has no clan name and goes by his childhood nickname instead, Four-Strings, because he carried around a broken lute with only four strings. Rizeron was not under dragon rule like most Draconic nations, but Khalugar is skeptical of dragons none the less. Khal has been on the road since he was a child by most races standards, but a full dragonborn adult. After leaving town, Khal traveled from town to town, performing and busking for any coin he could scrape up. While living as a vagabond, Khal used much of that coin to gamble, finding faith in Lady Luck. While a gambler, he is very protective of his gold and keeps his valuables close. Low-key greedy, but doesn‚Äôt like to let it show or define him. Khal has found himself spending the last three months in the desert oasis of Salasar, performing while taken part in an underground gambling ring. He is up and has amassed a bit of wealth, but had to quickly leave town due to an untimely tryst. Khal has used the wealth he amassed through gambling and performing to travel to Sandpoint to begin a new life.

In Session 1, I hid the fact that I'm a bard. He was eavesdropping on the party as they got their first quest and joined them telling them about where he's from and the warriors they breed, also that he has a bit of casting ability. In our first battle, he cast minor illusion to create a loud dragon's roar, and then fumbled with his crossbow for two turns without actually firing it while hiding behind cover. (He's never actually been in a fight) No PCs have questioned his warrior story, but everyone is pretty new and I've let them know they are welcome to if their character would.

Some of his characteristics and traits:

* A hopeless romantic, always searching for that ""special someone.""
* Overly protective of his gold. Recovering hoarder. Low-key greedy, but doesn‚Äôt like to let it show or define him. Has never returned anything he borrows.
* Hedonist. Takes pleasure in all of life‚Äôs enjoyments. Women, men, alcohol, soft drugs, etc.
* Early on in campaign, he likes to think everyone has heard of him as a bard, but no one really has. Starlord or Jack Sparrow like. As the campaign goes on, he may or may not actually be known and loved.
* Personal quest to garner as much love and as many ‚Äúfollowers/fans‚Äù as possible.
* Like most Dragonborn, he's' dedicated to excellence.
* He's a sucker for a pretty face.
* Has a gambling addiction. Will ALWAYS take a bet, no matter what.
* Will try to strike a deal instead of paying for something in gold.
* Warrant out for his arrest in Salasar due to sleeping with a nobleman‚Äôs wife.

I've also created a bit of a disadvantage mechanic for him. He's dragonborn, so a reptile, and I thought it would be fun to make him cold blooded and need to sit out in the sun each morning (RP'd in the first few sessions and then just assumed it's happening on a normal sunny/cloudy day). If he's down in a cave or somewhere where there isn't sun, or it's a snowy environment, he'll need to find an alternative method of warming up or else he rolls STR/DEX/CON at disadvantage until later in the day.

I guess beyond all of that, there isn't too much depth. What are his motives? Who are his family and how do they feel about casting him out? What are his long term goals?

For added insight: He is a 6'7"" 300lb. Brass Dragonborn - Chaotic Neutral. Entertainer Background

* STR: 12
* DEX: 14
* CON: 12
* INT: 9
* WIS: 11
* CHA: 16

Typical bard spells and cantrips, but my DM has also allowed us each to choose a homebrewed ""zodiac"" during character creation. I chose ""The Staff"" allowing me to choose two cantrips from the Bard/Sorcerer/Wizard spell list and one more at both lvls 7 and 14. Naturally, chose Fire Bolt (which works RP-wise as a fire dragon), but also Chill Touch and I'd love to have some small story as to how he learned such a Necromancy spell. Not sure what my lvl 7 and 14 cantrips will be yet, and know I'll get more non-bard spells just by being a bard, but hopefully I'll have a better grasp on who he is and can RP those decisions. (Hadn't chosen my zodiac yet during session 1, so didn't have fire bolt or chill touch during that first battle. Hence the crossbow fumbling RP.)",1

DnD,akkronym,12,"What do you do when one of your players is conspicuously bad at roleplaying? Not sure if this is the right sub for this but I've lurked here for a while and it seemed like a good resource to try to consult. 

Some friends and I recently started a text-only discord campaign because we had schedules that didn't overlap enough for us to have any kind of regular live sessions. 

Obviously that carries with it some extra challenges but most of us have all been DMs ourselves or at least been players a couple of times. We also decided to include a newbie in the campaign that was a mutual friend with most of us; we know it takes some time for newbies to get familiar with the format and the rules and so there was a discussion before we started between the players who had been DMs about how to try to lead by example and not dominate the conversation or hog the spotlight so that the newer characters had opportunities to figure things out. 

We're a couple months into campaign and it's just not clicking for him. The other players will take turns writing a paragraph or two about what their characters are doing or saying and why and how they feel about doing it, and then he'll show up and respond with something like ""CharacterName says 'I agree.'"" and that's the whole post and the DM just has to move the story forward. 

We've asked if there's anything he needs help with or to reach out if he feels overwhelmed or needs advice, but he's not asking for help. A few of us have shared resources in the group chat for roleplaying tips and stuff but he doesn't appear to be reading them. 

It feels like it would be mean to just pull him aside and say ""Hey your writing is bad. Write better."" but on the other hand, it's really deflating to be having a really intense moment in character and feeding off the energy of the other people in the group and then have all of that ground to a halt for the roleplaying equivalent of ""k."" 

The other players and the DM have noticed it too - we're just not sure what to do about it. We're pretty proactive communicators and we've had disruptive or inattentive players before, but since we're used to IRL sessions, the strength of someone's narration or prose was never really an issue before. 

Have any of you ever dealt with something like this? Does confronting it make it better, if so how'd you go about it? If you used to have this problem, what resources or advice did you receive that helped you improve? Really any sort of advice would be appreciated.",1

I even bought some programs to be able to pipe Spotify to Google Hangouts, but Google Hangouts starts muting it (which makes sense, if someone's in a meeting and has background music, 99.9% of the time it's background noise that should be muted.)

DnD,EsperTheBard,11,"STUNNING STRIKE vs. MAGIC RESISTANCE I generally side with the lead developers on such issues. Thus far, I think the only one I have disagreed with is Jeremy Crawford stating that stunning strike is not magical.

""Neither the Ki feature nor the Stunning Strike feature (PH, 78 &amp; 79) is defined as magical for game purposes."" ‚Äî Jeremy Crawford

""THE MAGIC OF KI

Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse‚Äîspecifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents."" ‚Äî Player's Handbook, opening to the monk entry

I guess you could argue that ki magic is all ""behind the scenes"" and thus it is only the monk's really fast, precise fist that stuns targets, but ...

Why does the ki description say the attacks disrupt the magical energy that suffuses creatures?

Why can't any other class also just hit hard/fast/precise and stun creatures (fighter?)?

Why does the monk have to spend a magical resource to employ the effect?

Why can the monk stun creatures that merely smacking them hard would make no difference? Golems, oozes, elementals, undead, plants, etc. A creature made of pure stone or fire or slime doesn't have a nervous system to short-circuit with a punch or kick.

Why would magic resistance include the wording ""advantage against spells and ALL OTHER MAGICAL EFFECTS""?

Stunning strike is one of the most powerful abilities in all the game. A successful stun often turns the table of an entire battle. Monks can attempt multiple stuns per turn, and the ki points recharge every short rest. Applying the magic resistance therefore adds to the challenge and tension when fighting certain monsters.

It is ridiculous to imagine an angel, a devil, or a mindflayer resisting spells that would paralyze them or banish them, yet such resistance does nothing against a ki-stun.

I've been DM'ing 5E heavily for years now, including two 2-1/2-year-long campaigns that both have monk characters. Magic resistance has applied against stunning strike the whole time, and it has remained one of the most powerful, combat-altering effects I and my players have ever seen.",1

Every time they‚Äôre in a crowded area, the kleptomaniac bard with +15 to Sleight of Hand finds the richest people around and robs them. The rogue gets bored pretty easily and either sleeps with the NPCs or kills people. Already, they‚Äôve burned down a tavern with everyone inside (except for a baby whom they had their NPC monk rescue) for being racist, murdered people with no regard for their families (when they killed the bouncer outside the tavern, they found a note from his young child wishing he‚Äôs be safe), and looted the body of a child who died as a result of an enemy mage‚Äôs poorly aimed lightning.

My players have been helping out a town with their undead problem for a few days, but seeing as the undead keep coming and the town is running out of supplies, the mayor has tasked the players with either finding reinforcements or stoping the undead at the source. In the meantime of helping defend the city the players have decided to hunt down an elusive hag who has been terrorizing the town for generation's, thinking she is behind the undead. So they set out to work, learning about her, undoing curses, and generally being a nuisance in her plans, the only issue is they are running out of time before they have to leave. With only around a day left, I'm not sure how to have the players encounter the hag for a showdown because, in universe, the hag would be perfectly fine hiding in her cottage and letting the player leave.

Have the hag fight the players on the road after they've left to get her revenge for ""ruining her fun"". 3.

Ok, so my goup's got the bug, and to satisfy the itch between sessions we're looking at doing some almost play-by-post roleplaying in some sort of chat app. Basically, a place to roleplay out what you talked about around the campfire during the last long rest, what stupid jokes the rogue and warlock made behind the paladin's back while he was trying to convert some gnomes, whatever.

In the end I settled to just opening Photoshop up and drawing with the paint tools on that, which wasn't great.

Is there any online, or downloadable software I can get which would allow me to create environments and move the players myself while screen sharing to the rest of the players in the group? 

Any Help would be appreciated!",1

DnD,Adumtheone,6,"I have a question In Curse of Strahd, in the introduction adventure death house there is a place where you have to sacrifice a creature to a cult, i wonder, does it count if you revive the creature later?

&amp;#x200B;

If any character climbs to the top of the dais, read:

&gt;The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear on the ledges overlooking the room. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch‚Äôs fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you‚Äôd expect to see faces¬†are voids.  
‚ÄúOne must die!‚Äù they chant, over and over. ‚ÄúOne must die! One must die!‚Äù

The apparitions are harmless figments that can‚Äôt be damaged, turned, or¬†dispelled.

Characters on the dais when the cultists appear must sacrifice a creature on the altar or face the cult‚Äôs wrath; characters can ascertain what must be done with a successful DC 11 Intelligence ([**Religion**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion)) or Wisdom ([**Insight**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight)) check. To count as a sacrifice, a creature must die on the altar. The apparitions don‚Äôt care what kind of creature is sacrificed, and they aren‚Äôt fooled by¬†illusions.

If the characters make the sacrifice, the cultists fade away, but their tireless chant of ‚ÄúHe is the Ancient. He is the Land,‚Äù echoes again in the dungeon. Strahd is aware of the sacrifice, and Death House now does nothing to hinder the characters (see ‚ÄúEndings‚Äù below).

If the characters leave the dais without making the sacrifice, the cultists‚Äô chant changes: ‚ÄúLorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!‚Äù This chant rouses the shambling mound and prompts it to attack. It pursues prey beyond the room but won‚Äôt leave the dungeon. It can move through tunnels without squeezing and completely fills its space. At the start of the shambling mound‚Äôs first turn, the chant changes again: ‚ÄúThe end comes! Death, be praised!‚Äù If the shambling mound dies, the chanting stops and the apparitions vanish forever.",1

DnD,bugzthecat,18,"Need Help With Problem Player Hello.

I have a player in my play group that with each time he has made a character, has made it to where it hurts the campaign. He doesn't do anything broken. If anything he insists on being underpowered or misusing a class and it's abilities in order to be the support tank when you can't really be the support thank for those roles. 

In two campaigns he was in with me, once he was party leader and refused to do anything but talk to NPC's to solve the mystery. When my players brought up something very unique, he stated both in and out of character that they thought it was stupid since it had to do with his character having to do something that was 'against his code' or something. The other campaign, he told me that he doesn't like the setting and wouldn't understand why anyone would be there. Then made a character who actively didn't want to do anything to do with the campaign or its setting.

In my friends campaign he is using the sentinel ability just to dodge the whole time and has an underpowered character. This nearly killed a party member not once, but twice. I get the sense that he feels he is carrying the party when my character is rolling at least 3d6 and a d8 for her damage, a warlock always pumping out Eldritch Blasts and a mfing paladin. Combat is really boring since all he does is run in and dodge. His character also refuses to communicate with the source of their powers. Ultimately extremely lazy to the point of dragging his feet when it comes to getting the plot to move forward or wasting spellslots for the gag of food and sleep.

When I said something about how his character wasn't doing anything in one of my campaigns, he complained about how I just didn't like that he was playing his character. He got extremely angry when our DM asked him what his source of power would think of his actions and he hates that his character would have to have a connection. 

It is making my DM's job very hard and making my fun as a player very boring. My character is, also, becoming fed up with his and I fear that she's just going to let him have it one of these days. I've talked to another play group about how to handle it and I'm still kinda worried of a tantrum coming at my DM. Does anyone have a way to start this conversation lightly? My DM is trying to give each character an arc, so I suggested that could be a way to try to get his character interesting, but I still don't know. 

Any suggestions?",1

DnD,Uncertain_Millenial,11,"How much of my players' near-death is my fault? I'm currently running a 5e campaign with 6 players. It's an official adventure (keeping it vague in case they stumble upon this) but it's balanced for 4 players. The only change I've made has been to impose exhaustion upon dropping to zero hp. This is because the majority of my players are reasonably seasoned veterans, and I wanted to give them a challenge, force them to second-guess kicking down a door, and if they do end up in combat, think more tactically. I posed the option at session zero and they all went for it.

They're currently at level 3, and so far have split up, rushed headlong into combat, etc. and have wound up unconscious several times each, sometimes multiple times in a single combat. The pace of the game has slowed to a crawl, as each session starts with two hours of planning, then botched execution and near-death. I'm worried they're getting too paranoid to act, even though they aren't changing their strategies. Should I consider rolling back this extra rule, or do I stick it out and hope they learn to change their tactics?

TL;DR: A homebrew rule imposing exhaustion on zero hp has resulted in stubborn players consistently nearing death. Who's at fault?

DnD,GreyWormy,33,"3.5 players, what made you switch to 5e? I run a 3.5 game, mostly because it's the system all of my players already know. I own several 5e books though, and I've played it before, but I can't figure out what the appeal of it is to people who are already familiar with 3.5 and its rules.

From what I do know, it's not as rule-heavy, and you usually don't have to keep track of a series of +1s or -1s because much of it has been replaced with the advantage/disadvantage system. And that does a lot to keep the game from getting bogged down...usually. And also the classes are more balanced.

The reason 3.5 appeals to me personally is because of all the options available. It's kind of hard to make a character in 5e that feels wholly different from their base character class. The feat, skill, and PrC options are really sparse, and it's not easy to translate them from 3.5 to 5e. Wiz from the beginning said 5e was made to be homebrew-able to adjust to players' preferences, but homebrewing 5e to feel more like 3.5 would be a Herculean effort, and at the end of the day you may as well just play 3.5 and just deal with having to do more addition.

Now of course, complexity is not always a good thing. But 5e **is** doomed to reach 3.5's complexity at some point. WotC can't really make money off 5e without releasing more and more expansions, so in a few years you won't be able to bring a Fighter 10 to the table and remain somewhat comparable to the guy who brought a Wizard 1/Cleric 4/Mystic Theurge 2/ Void Disciple 3.

Dragon Fear fits well with his personality, but HAM fits well with how I‚Äôve ended up playing (tank, buffer, with occasional high damage output).

DnD,Verifiedvenuz,12,"A different way to look at intelligence vs wisdom. The more I look at wisdom abilities in dnd, the more I realize wisdom in dnd is not the traditional idea of wisdom.  

 Wisdom is usually seen as learned experience and retrospect but I think it's something a little more general in dnd.   

Medicine is wisdom, not intelligence and I think I understand why now.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

int: your ability to know. To recall things you read in books or were taught. And ability to learn new things.  

wis: your ability to think, approach new things, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say your character finds out someone has a tumor, and wants to medically remove it.

&amp;#x200B;

intelligence: ""How do I remove \*\*a\*\* tumor."" 

Wisdom: ""How do I remove \*\*this\*\* tumor.""  

""low int high wis: ""I will not try to remove this tumor, because I would only make things worse.""  

High int low wis: ""I will perform the procedure I was taught, even if there might be a safer method.""  

High int high wis: ""I will remove this tumor in the safest possible way. "" 

""Low int low wis: ""Oh fuck I killed them.""

&amp;#x200B;

This might be a bad example, since wis is the only modifier for your medicine score but this is just meant to be an example.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also think of Charisma as almost a form of wisdom or intelligence, but specifically in regards to other people. A character who has high int, high wis and low cha might be really good at understanding and predicting most things but struggle with sapient lives who can be less predictable. Charisma would probably also be the ability to abstractly think in other people's shoes.   
A high int characters knows what intimidates people, a high cha character knows what intimidates \*you\*.",1
DnD,Halseahn,3,"A Deal with a Devil Let me provide a little bit of backstory before I get into this. Firstly, I am a player in a campaign with several friends. The campaign itself is being run by a relatively new Dungeon Master and it is supposed to resemble Descent into Avernus. He asked that we start at level three because characters are apparently boring until then. This is maybe our fifth session now, and it has been an experience to say the least. We were given an ""Orb of Translocation"" to teleport back to our guild which one of our players owns in case we got into trouble, note for later. 

So the story on hand is after we managed to break into a deserted cultist temple which had numerous traps including a lighting bolted Gylph of Warding, crossbow traps, cones of fire (might have been a burning hands). Anyway, getting into this cultist temple was an ordeal. The door was locked from inside somehow despite no one being inside. We cleared it out after finally killing some random gargoyle in the basement. 

So after all that, we head to leave, only to hear people lighting the temple on fire with arrows. Cool, no problem. We decide to use the Orb of Translocation and go back to the guild. We hadn't rested and fighting what turns out to be a very badly balanced encounter was not in our interest. 

Welp, turns out that orb actually teleported us to ""Hell's Waiting Room"", which is a comical waiting room where we got magic ticket numbers. The receptionist told us virtually nothing beside the name of the room. We then got sent into a room with a huge thirty foot tall Devil whose name we did not know, and he would not share. 

The real problem starts here; we were told to sign a contract which we literally could not read (it was written in mixed common and infernal, which we all knew) no matter how high our checks, OR go back to the waiting room and die. 

We were literally forced to sell our souls in character just to play the campaign. 

Now I do realize the Dungeon Master is newish and learning, but that is insane. We were given an item just to force us into a deal with a Devil just to further the campaign plot.

Why then, when I enjoy pretty much every single campaign I've watched/played in, does the unanimously revered and almost certainly most popular campaign for 5e do absolutely nothing for me? I feel like I'm overlooking or missing something? Is it one that isn't great to watch and it's one you really have to play to be able to get into and enjoy. Is it just because I've always been a fan of things like Lord of the Rings and never Van Helsing that I can't get into the 'vibe' or 'feel' of it? Does anyone else have this issue?

You ate your patron.

Imagine some powerful angel (or other celestial) falls from the sky wounded while your character is just hunting for food one day. (Character should be around 14-17 when this happens)

Your character has NO healing skills whatsoever and giving it a try fails horribly. 

The celestial pats you on the arm and says ""It was worth a try child. However I'm sure these wounds are beyond anything a mortal could heal."" And then explains there's a war in the heavens and a curse on that plane so any celestial that dies soul will turn evil when it revives.

""Eat me."" The celestial says shocking the child ""If my body is consumed my spirit won't be corrupted by [Create evil God here].""

Your character takes a bite of its arm and after swallowing it they feel nothing but the angel is satisfied that they won't be turned when they die. And they die.

You carry the body home and cut it into food. That morning you feed your family the cut up angel pieces (since you couldn't hunt anything else)

That night your woken up to demons/Devils attacking your family. Appon seeing the death of your little sister You discover your elditch blast and kill the demons/Devils.

The town guard show up a few minutes later and immediately think ""This guy went crazy and killed his family""

So you escape and have demons hunting you down, a kingdom that wants your imprisoned and probably have a heavens worth of angels that want to curb stomp your head into the ground.",1

DnD,ChaseOnABox,3,"Making my first homebrew subclass This is somewhat related to my previous post I made a few hours ago. I wanted to play a a guy who could control ravens and wield a spear similar to Odin from Norse mythology. While the advice I got was great I decided I wanted to try making my first subclass, the Raven Master.

It's based on the Raven queen warlock subclass but I want to put an ephisis more on using the ravens to spy, give you passive buffs, or make you more deadly against whoever a raven is targeting. There are two as a nod to Huginn and Muninn, Odin's two ravens who give Odin information as effectively spies and messengers.

I would love some help tweaking this homebrew subclass to make it more balanced while still remaining in theme. I decided to make this for a fighter (I know they have a million made but this is what I wanted to make anyway).

*Raven Master Martial Archetype

3rd level:

Ravens

You have formed a telepathic link to two ravens. These ravens are friendly to you and obey your commands. You may gives these commands telepathically as a bonus action. You can see everything they can and you instinctually always know where they are.

The ravens have the statistics of the Raven in the monster manual. The ravens don't need to sleep and can wake you up as a bonus action. The ravens disappear when they die and after a long rest appear on a nearby structure or plant as if nothing happened.*

This is basicly a rip from the Raven queen warlock subclass. I decided to make it to where you could only see as a way to balance the two ravens.

*7th level

I'll Omen

You may have a raven stalk a target. When you make an attack you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack. This damage increases by 1d6 at the 10th 15th and 18th level.*

This is essentially hunters mark on up to two creatures. The damage probably needs a nerf as I would want you be able to have either one or both the ravens target a creature. This would be a problematic 8d6 on one creature at the 18th level.

*10th level

Raven's foresight

 When the ravens are on the same space as you (effectively on your shoulder or something) you are granted additional AC equal to (number). (Or resistance to something)*

I haven't fully decided weather they should give a passive buff to your skills like they do in the Raven queen subclass or if they should buff your defenses either by granting resistance or AC. I'd want the ravens to stack this way as well. Having more ravens on to boost your defense at the cost of less damage.

*15th level

Raven warp

You may teleport to either of your raven or have your ravens teleport to you or the other raven. If you would appear in a space currently occupied by another creature other than the ravens you appear in the closest available space.*

This is kinda straight forward. I'm willing to have this change completely but it was inspired by the swarm keeper ranger sub classes feature that let you teleport to your swarm.

*18th level

Work in progress.*

I'm not sure what to make for the 18th level. I'm open to ideas.

Thank you to everyone for their time and constructive criticism and suggestions.",1

DnD,Megav16,19,"Will these cantrip homebrew changes be too busted? Hello there, I am about to run a game where the PCs are young adventurers learning the ropes from some experienced pros. In the game I wanted to show the uniqueness of certain characters by showing how different people have modified spells or created their own spells that are different than standard options. 

One such change that I wanted to introduce just in general for the players is that with practice they can enhance a few cantrips beyond their normal limits. So far I have thought of lifting the restriction on booming blade and green flame blade to count as weapon attacks so that they can be used in multiattack. I also wanted to change shocking grasp into a melee attack that could eventually benefit in the same way and have synergy some other martial class features. 

I know those two spells are there to boost the damage of non multiattack pcs but I am not sure if this change will make the players so strong that they never want to use spell slots. I am ideally hoping that someone can try to theory craft how this can be abused so that I can see if its too much to include as a pc option, although I can always adjust the game for them if they do become really strong. 

If anyone has done something similar or had similar ideas then let me know.

DnD,leapingcarrot,6,"Need Help Creating A Cleric (5e) So, I'm new to the game. My whole group are novices, and we're starting with the Icespire Keep campaign to see how it goes. 

I've assigned myself the healer role and plan to be a Half Elf Cleric.  The idea is to make my character have a connection to the city/village of Phandalin (if you're familiar with the campaign setting), by starting out as one of the town ""npc's"" as a Librarian the adventurers stumble into, at which point my characters joins them for the adventure.

Now, here's where I'm having a hard time. Backstory, religion, domains and deities. I want to be of the Knowledge Domain, because I feel it makes sense with my occupation as a librarian (I also went with the Sage background). I think that all works, but none of it really makes me a ""Cleric"". So I need ideas for how I'm a cleric that ended up working in a library, I need a reason to leave said library and I need a deity/god that makes sense for my character to worship and  a holy symbol that fits.

The one thought I had was what if my Cleric was given power by one of the ""knowledge deities"", but he sort of felt like the Gods must have made a mistake - because he didn't feel knowledgable or literate in any way (maybe he stole a paperwork from a student in his adolescence and thought the Gods mistook him for said student?) and ever since he's been over-thinking and over-studying to fit the part assigned to him by the knowledge deity. So his character struggles with the balance act of trying to come off as intellectual, scribe-like while having this inherent feeling that he knows nothing, hence wanting to join the adventurers for a sense of real learning? 

Just for your information, the RP of it is much more important than the mechanics to me, so the fact that Knowledge Cleric isn't the best doesn't really matter to me if that makes sense.

I don't know, does any of this work? What is an interesting Cleric you've roleplayed, and do you have any pointers here?",1

DnD,Vinne203,0,"First of many DND sessions. Home brew story below Howdy! Tonight I ran my first game with my brother and his friend that we‚Äôve planning for the past few weekends, kept falling through, but tonight it didn‚Äôt! 
My players were two lvl 10 goliaths, a paladin and a warlock. They restrained the wyvern by standing on its wings and holding its neck, divine smited the hell out of its skull, tore apart some kobolds. And they currently just got all the treasure in the room but, haven‚Äôt found dragon eggs yet, or killed the boss, but the door is unlocked now.

I had 3 maps prepared, treasure and monsters prepped, no encounter table, no NPCs written up, traps too. 

Although I have been reading some articles on Dndbeyond about playing theatre of the mind style to ease combat and jumping back into the swing of things afterwards. 
Things I pointed out to work on 
‚Ä¢ reading the players back in on their turns ‚Äústanding next to your companion after they just blocked an arrow with their shield from the goblins ahead, what do you do‚Äù 
Instead of just what do you do your turn roll
‚Ä¢loot on enemies, I‚Äôve only used treasure chests so far and I like it, it might get the habit out of wanting to loot loot loot, I want to have more Indiana Jones style to get loot work for it 
‚Ä¢getting an idea of how combat will go ahead of time, for example I really want to bring out to my players that wyverns are dumb compared to other dragons and will charge for their prey head on, so pre fighting as a monster

So now,
The players started on a dirt road with forests on each side, guards behind them had walked them to this point but now they leave them here and say they will be here to collect the bodies. 
So the players walk about 40ft forwards to a wooden post marking a crossroads. 
The path splits off two ways
One along the right, the light that once shone through the trees is cut off as it gets denser along this forest trail, a scout runs along ahead and gets eaten by a T. rex, then pursues the players.
Or, 
Two, up the steep trail along the mountain path to get a view of the main goal, the supposed entrance to the dungeon of the mad mage (not related to official content). At the top is a vantage point where the scout runs to the edge points out the graveyard filled with kobolds and the entrance to the dungeon, then gets chomped by a wyvern, que combat. 
After this the players thru the forest reach the main entrance of the graveyard guarded by 5 kobolds or they slide down a gravel hill into the side of the graveyard, to either stealth in or kill everything. There are two carts being pushed by kobolds along stone paths in the graveyard, one is filled with bodies being put into graves, collected from villages for future summoning uses... and the second is filled with gold and treasure collected of the corpses. 
There are two winged kobolds guarding the entrance to the dungeon who fly towards any scream from a kobold sensing intruders. 
As well as two kobolds pacing around bonfires burning personal possessions and clothes of the corpses.
Into the dungeon.
There are 3 sets of 10ft squares with symbols on them. As well as a simple cloth pit before the tiles in case any one thinks they are being safe not stepping on tiles, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling here. Earth, air then water. 
Stepping on the earth tiles releases a Boulder trap at the end of the long corridor the players just walked into. Then the air symbols are safe. To the left of the water symbols is another 10ft square simple pit trap with a kobold tunnel at the bottom that leads to the kobolds bunks, and the puzzle to open the boss room door. 

Kobold tunnels, the left path takes the players to a puzzle mechanism that opens a previously locked door in the long corridor to the boss. 
The right is the kobold bunks with like 11 kobolds. There‚Äôs a bookshelf hiding a treasure room with 3 chests, under one chest is another kobold tunnel to a blue dragon egg nest with loot and three eggs.

The boss room is a young blue dragon and afterwards a hole will open to the 2nd chamber...",1

My players recently fought their biggest villain yet: an ancient green dragon named Beltesha. Her story could fill several pages, so I'll summarize: like most green dragons, she loved to manipulate others, to the point that she wanted to be directly involved. She learned how to shapechange like a metallic dragon, and unlocked some other innate magical talent in her draconic blood. She used this shapechange ability to capture and replace a human noble, and spent the past fifteen years working her way up the power structure through legitimate means (as a self-imposed challenge, she didn't use her draconic might, acting the part of a lowly human). Her most defining flaw is ""I am never satisfied.""

She was all set up to be crowned queen after the death of the previous king, but the party found the last living heir, who was chosen to be crowned instead. Her decade and a half of planning foiled, she dropped all pretense and attacked. The party is made up of four level 15 characters with pretty solid magic items, and they had the support of many allies to balance the scales. Beltesha was overwhelmed, and forced to use her trump card: her innate Teleport spell. The Redemption paladin tried to counterspell it, but failed the DC 17 charisma check, and she got away.

So I'm workin' a concept based on Marvel's Magik. Havin' a bit of confliction on a few points though and am hopeful people with past experience or other insights might help out.

I took level 1 in Shadow Sorcerer. Mostly For the saves, but also cause Magik was stolen to hell, not created there. I took Human of Passage cause her innate mutation is teleporting. Completely happy with these choices.

I took level two in Hexblade Warlock. This is obviously to use her Soulblade a bit. The CURRENT concept, is using a longsword and a shield. The idea is to use a reskinned shield. Using a shield takes an action to don or doff, so, for an action she can summon/dismiss her Soularmor. Which will provide 2AC. (For 16 AC using mage armor).

This leads to a few issues. The foremost being spellcasting in melee. If I have the Soularmor out my casting becomes super restricted. Not so bad if I'm using the versatile part of the longsword and going 2h. Ways to fix this? The best I've come up with is Improved Pact Weapon, more on that later.

Level three will almost certainly be Warlock. I will most likely be taking the at-will mage armor Invocation, and then something else. We have an Artificer, so I figure they'll get the first half plate. I should likely aim for bracers of armor instead. Minorly leaning towards the at-will tempHp, to be replaced later. Maybe. Herein lies the issue.

Should I stop at Warlock 2? If so, what should my second invocation be? Shadow Sorc will take care of the darkness/devil sight combo. Do I go for the Pact? That would also improve my Warlock spell slot level. I kinda liked the idea of going Chain, and getting an IMP to help with advantage and also because Magik is a devil controlin' girl. I think, only sorta know her. Does she summon shit often? Ever? If I'm going for 3, should I just get 5 for the big bump? Is thirsting blade + bonus cantrip better economy than 2x cantrip each round? At 5 I also get another invocation and a bump to Warlock slots.

If I'm going to 5, I might as well do 6 right? For the soul shackling shit, which I like for the concept of the character. I -will- be going for Shadow Sorcerer 6, I had planned for most of the levels to be Sorc, but is it better to do Warlock? Should I go chain and just hope I get bracers of armor to alleviate my casting issues, thus avoiding the need for improved pact weapon?

So many choices, not sure what the best/most fun option is. With a strong lean towards character concept over min-max. Not really sure, are bracers of armor late game and hard to find? Bad way to plan a toon?

DnD,Turin082,21,"Suckered a player into a card game with a fey and they said it was one of the tensest and funnest times they've had. The set up: The party just came off of their ""shopping"" episode in a town and have come back to the local inn to rest before leaving town. The bartender offers the party's bard a spot in a game being played downstairs and he says ""Well, I've got two gold to my name at the moment so maybe show me to the penny slots?"" The bartender replies that money isn't the buy in for this game.

This intrigues the bard enough to check it out. The bartender gives him a token which he uses to get past the guard for the game down stairs and he makes his way into the wine cellar. At a dimly lit table in the corner is sitting a goblin, a kenku, a kobald, and a pixie. The goblin, kobald, and kenku are all suspicious at first but the pixie happily invites the bard to sit down and explains the game to him. I go over that it's effectively texas hold 'em, each player roll 2 d13 and I roll 5 d13 in the background, reveal the first three numbers and then the last two as players make their bets. And then I explain that the wager is aspects of his character. For instance, he could wager hit dice and if he wins he'd get as many hit dice as he wagered on top of his normal ones, but would lose that number if he lost. And he could do this with anything, be it proficiencies, bardic inspirations, spell slots, even spells themselves where if he lost he would lose access to that spell but if he won I would upgrade the spell in some way.

After hearing the explanation he is very intrigued but just trepidatious enough to be hesitent. He agrees and we start the game. The players get their cards, bets are made, round and round until all the cards are turned over. By then he's wagered his Heat Metal spell, a point of dexterity, and his proficiency with performance. He's used performance and intimidation to make the kenku and the kobald fold but the goblin has wagered his courage so he calls. They flip their cards over and the bard wins. The goblin suddenly shrinks in terror and runs out of the cellar screaming and the bard now has a newly upgraded Heat Metal spell (I changed the damage die to a d10 instead of a d8), another point of dexterity bringing him up to 18, and expertise in performance. The pixie congratulates him, sits in the chair the goblin was sitting in and offers another game and the bard happily pushes back from the table, thanks everyone there, and quickly books it out of the cellar too.

Everyone said that was the perfect blend of exhilarating and terrifying and it was tense right up until the goblin showed his hand. It was super fun and I hope other DMs add it to their games. Sure it has the potential to make the player over powered but there's just as much chance to totally screw them over and it was a fantastic bit of RP.",1

DnD,Shoebox_ovaries,9,"Dealing with cheaters who are also good friends I DM a group of decade old friends, went through highschool and stayed friends post college as a gaming group. We have all played DnD throughout this entire time, and currently are in the middle of a campaign. 

For context we play on Tabletop Simulator.

This friend, we'll call Z, has been the butt of cheating jokes when he cheated in a game of *Removed for Anonyminity* years and years ago. Just a stupid joke amongst friends. However, months prior, during this game, he re-rolled a 1 that he had gotten and was caught by multiple people on our table. I punished that in a minor way, giving the NPC a free grapple break and disengage movement closer towards the exit. Not out of the fight, not a smite from above -- something minorly annoying for the entire party for what I thought was just a one time frustration move.

However tonight he did it again. 

For additional context and for those DM's that are playing on Tabletop Simulator, you can right click a dice and select the number you want to have on top. And if you right click it, hit R to roll, and click the number, in a clever way you can make it appear like it rolled the number naturally. It still has weird unnatural movement, but if you know that people just casually watch you roll it will appear legit. 

Also, whenever you hit R to roll a dice in Tabletop Sim, lets say it goes up a foot in the air. If you use this method to change the dice roll while its resting on the table, it will only go up four inches in the air as it orients itself to the number selected. Also, for all the DMs out there, the dice will always reorient itself to face the player using the method. It will be perfectly lined up for that players perspective to read it. Not the easiest thing to spot, but I did a lot of testing and that is the easiest way to tell. 

After Z had cheated months ago I had begun watching his rolls very frequently. Nearly all of them, and especially during combat. For his attack roll it landed on a 1, and half a second later it popped up in a much lower height and flipped to a 20. I immediately said 'I saw that.' and Z quickly responded with 'Saw what?'. At the moment we were in a very harrying combat for myself, and DMing already has a lot on its plate, so I didn't really punish Z at the time. My attention was already on multiple things and we don't have time for me to think of an appropriate punishment, so I just had Z reroll the attack. Atm I'm pretty frustrated so I wished I had called Z out in a greater way during the game, but still - wanted to get through the session and not ruin it for everyone else. 

Now I feel like I *have* to have a one on one chat with Z, but I don't know if I want it to go 'You're not allowed at the table because you cheat' -- as I feel that it could be very stressful on my otherwise great friendship with him, or a 'If you do this again, you're out.' chat. 

I don't want to play without him, but I don't want to play with him while I have to actively monitor his cheating. After tonight I spoke with two other players who said they will try to remember to watch his rolls, but I feel like that might be too distracting for myself *and* my other friends. On top of it all, after the first cheat roll I would have kicked out any other person if they were a total stranger. Giving him a second chance already has me feel like I gave Z a lot of leeway due to friendship. A second time is making it much harder for me.",1

DnD,silverdragonwolf,33,"Things that should probably get addressed with updates to the game  As a History major, I take offense to a few things that most players don't really bother to think about. Bows are incredible, their varieties are truly astounding. That said, I am disappointed that shields in 5e only give a +2 bonus, especially when you consider the variety of historical shields there are. Smaller shields like the targe, heater shield, and buckler make sense with the +2 to AC, and those are the 3 kinds of shield usually depicted in official D&amp;D art but the larger shields like the Nordic shield (also referred to as the Viking shield), scutum (traditional Roman legion shield), and Kite Shield (the biggest known shield) likely would need to give a bit more of a bonus to AC due to their size, the Kite Shield would likely also incur a movement penalty when in use due to its size and design.

There are things we all get hung up on, and for me, it's the way equipment is treated and described in the official D&amp;D material, there are things that were carried over from prior editions that weren't properly corrected and there are things that just can't fit the streamlined structure of 5e by their very nature. War Hammers do more than Bludgeoning, the side opposite of the hammerhead has a spike and that can easily deal piercing damage, daggers can deal cuts in addition to piercing damage, Rapiers are ironically in the same boat as daggers, and so on. What the source material describes as a ""longsword"" is actually what's known as an Arming Sword, historical longswords are closer to what is commonly referred to as a hand-and-a-half sword. My point is weapons and equipment in-game don't usually line up with their supposed real-world counterparts if you go by what the D&amp;D source materials say.

&amp;#x200B;

D&amp;D has come a long way, 5e has pulled more from history (both of D&amp;D as a whole and real-world) than any of its predecessors but the teams behind the source materials have still made some clear missteps when you take the time to compare things with what are supposed to be the real-world equivalents. As much as I would love to see the Legionnaire make an appearance as a Fighter archetype, I'm more than a bit frightened by the potential mishandling that can come from improper execution. Whould I like to see Shinobi (the term for a male shinobi is Ninja and the term for a female ninja is Kunoichi)Would make an appearance as an official class? Of course but I'm worried that what archetypes we do see will pull more from anime, manga, and popculture than historical records on shinobi. Sometimes you need someone to get everyone to slow down and actually verify things, not just go for it because it's popular or in high demand.",1

DnD,124y5t3q4,0,"Ferideh Jujing the Spellbound draft 2 **Name: Ferideh Jujing The Spellbound**

**Description:**

Ferideh is a half-dragon born from a half-elf nobleman and her mother was a blue dragon. Her draconic features are incredibly subdued being two large horns on her head, blue-green hair that shimmers like ocean water, sharp fangs, and claws instead of nails.

However, as the game progresses, and Ferideh levels up, her draconic heritage starts to become more noticeable. Ferideh‚Äôs feet will turn into sharp talons at level 5, she‚Äôll grow a powerful tail at level 6, and develop the ability to change her arms to wings at level 10.

**Personality:**

(Personality traits are still under development)

**Background:**

It all started when a female blue dragon enlisted an army of orcs to lay siege on an elven kingdom many years back, claiming to be a messenger of **Ilneval**. But as the orcs had overrun the elf troops who were making their way for the gate, the blue dragon swooped in and decimated the invading army in a barrage of lightning and fire. The elves thanked their new savior and pledged allegiance to her in exchange for her continued protection and care.

In spite of her snobbiness and exceeding pride, the dragon was an outwardly benevolent and forgiving ruler to her people as she knew to oppress the people would result in rebellion. And as years went by, she grew accustomed to fellow politicians, knowing them by name. She learned to pull their strings through flattery, half-truths, and bribery to keep them loyal. Behind the scenes, she even developed a huge monopoly of potions, elixirs, and other rare materials in the black market.

Many years later, arranged marriage between a half-elf nobleman and the dragon in order to cement her legacy on her domain. Thus, the *elf ¬º, human ¬º, half-dragon*, Ferideh was born. However, as time passed, she actually came to love the child she and her husband conceived as her daughter. But with all the accomplishments of her mother, alongside the innate pride and vanity of her species, jealousy, and ambition filled Ferideh's mind.

When Ferideh was 15, she decided to go off on a journey to escape her family's shadow and make a name for herself. For many years, she lived a very shady and desperate existence as something of a traveling trader of sometimes botched potions, guides, and occasional killer-for-hire. Ferideh has created, sold, dispelled, and documented many different potions and elixirs. Dabbling in wild and untamed magic lurking inside of her being.

**Class: Wild Sorcerer/Assassin or fighter (haven‚Äôt decided)**

Without her parents' knowledge, Ferideh took to studying the magic coursing through her thanks to her draconic heritage. She is an avid collector of potions and magical spells. Being a part blue dragon, Ferideh has some control over lightning. But due to her inexperience, her magic has a 20% chance of going wild.

In spite of her descent hand in magic, Ferideh usually saves it for when it's absolutely necessary (or when she gets really pissed off by someone). Ferideh instead prefers to rely on melee combat, using either her claws, daggers, and teeth to tear her opponents to shreds.",1

DnD,TheRealKaz,6,"Playing online, my players can't see me facepalm when they do stupid shit. I love the players in my campaign. I do. They're great friends, convincing role players, and just a fun bunch to spend a few hours with every week.

&amp;#x200B;

But, sometimes... they're the not exactly the sharpest knives in the drawer. Sometimes, they're spoons in the knife drawer. I thought I would share some of their misadventures.

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest time, our ranger insisted he must always scout ahead and travel a mile in front of the rest of the group. For obvious reasons, this got him in trouble. Eventually, he learned.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, our rogue developed the habit of thinking she must always sneak off and explore a separate area from everyone else. Naturally, the group spent many an encounter rescuing this rogue. Bless her heart, she just kept doing it. It also took her a solid two months to learn that D&amp;D isn't Skyrim, and that she can't just stand in an open, snowy field, roll stealth, and become invisible, but I'll chalk that up to being new.

&amp;#x200B;

About three months ago, before coronavirus forced us to go online, my group of five players at level 5 lost a fight to a fairly weak group of CR3 creatures whom they have shat on in the past. It was the end of the session as the last of them fell. I did tell them they weren't dead, but they had to wait until our next session to discover what really happened (they had to play some NPCs they were allied with to rescue their characters from slavery). In the mean time, we talked about what happened, because it should have been a very doable encounter for them. It all boiled down to the fact that their group does not believe in focus fire. When the fight started, they all ran to separate enemies and tried to fight mano-e-mano.

&amp;#x200B;

The rescue was temporarily delayed by attendance (since it would take all of them), and in the meantime we started a small sub-campaign over lower-level characters that let them explore a different area and aspect of the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the second session of these low level characters, three of them at level two went to a cave to find some eggs. A fight started, and the same player that plays the aforementioned ranger ran around the corner to ""try to cut them off at the other end of the tunnel"", turning the fight with one CR 1 monster into a fight with two CR 1 monsters. All of their spells were expended. The purpose of finding these eggs was to use as bait. Due to some poor rolling and lack of thoroughly searching the cave (such as writing down or marking where they had searched), they had only a single egg that had been smashed by one of the players' boots.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, they decided that rather than wait and recover before the encounter they knew full well they were going to be having, they decided to rush to start it with I believe a single spell slot and no one at totally full health before the scent of the egg on the boot could wear off. Still, it should have been a doable (though tough) encounter. The three enemies appeared. For one round, it looked like the players would all focus on target before moving on. Then, they spent the remaining rounds each again trying to fight their own individual enemy. One of the fresh, low-level characters was lost.

&amp;#x200B;

The next week, as we were back to rescuing their main characters in the campaign proper, the players that had rushed the previous encounter regailed the players that had been absent that day of how they didn't learn their lesson and again split their focus across all present enemies (I did not have any input in the discussion this time, it was their own admission).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a good two months and we play the low-level characters again as a player critical to the next thing happening in the campaign proper was absent. We had five level two characters. They were to fight four CR 1/2 orcs, followed by an Orog by itself after the orcs were dead. Again, it should be taxing but very much doable (especially since one of them has sharpshooter and can literally one-shot the orcs but for some reason just didn't use it). But, once again, my players all ran off to fight their own orc individually. They spread themselves across the battlefield, sometimes not even in sight of each other, and played some youth soccer-style man-to-man defense with the orcs. They were rough. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the orog arrived, it got the best of them. As it was just a group of roaming bandit orcs, it stripped them of their weapons and bags (not armor, that's tedious), and left them there where they had to wake up and figure out a new solution (their new solution was to take a short rest, track the orog, and sneak around the orog's camp to start grabbing their weapons, and then all ambush the orog; it went swimmingly).

&amp;#x200B;

How many times do you let your players start making the exact same mistake before you just assign them a babysitter NPC to suggest that they do shit the right way?

&amp;#x200B;

It's a good thing we're playing online now, because they can't see how often my face is in the palm of my hand.",1

DnD,Grumlarkin,3,"Even more questions about Heat Metal I'm familiar with Heat Metal and its usual functions, and I have no problem with that, but I have some questions about 5e and explosives.

I'm brand new to running 5e. I run a game with gunpowder-tier weapons (flintlock era) and some enemies are using iron-banded black powder bombs as grenades (the iron banding acts as shrapnel once the bomb goes off)

Rules-based questions: Can Heat Metal, a spell that does fire damage, ignite any flammables? If so, would casting it on one of these black powder bombs set it off according to RAW? They're technically items mainly comprised of metal, and Heat Metal makes things glowing-hot to the point of dealing significant fire damage, but if there's anything written down in the rules about fire damage and flammables, I haven't found it yet.

RAW aside: *should* Heat Metal set off one of these bombs? I'm thinking yes, because there's plenty of metal on the outside of the object, the caster would be relinquishing the possibility of the usual damage over time, and because ""Fire Damage Makes Other Things Catch Fire"" is a classic staple of game logic/physics-- but I'm curious about whether or not that's a common sentiment among folks here.",1
DnD,GregTheDragon,16,"I've never wanted to quit a game until now(Rant) None of the other players or the DM in my game check this or know of my name on here so here I go. I've played in a number of games with a number of dms and I've never just been blatantly bored until now in a game.

- we have a large group of nearly 10 people and the combat or shopping just takes forever 

- Our DM is newer which is totally fine, but other more experienced players like to interrupt or lash out mid game about certain things. The DM is wrong, but the players are more wrong in my eyes because they're hauling the game and making it just weird and tense(not all but probably 4 or so)

- to top it off, the more combative players that lash out also metagame as hard as I've ever seen, acting immediately on info the other players received individually.

- the combat isn't balanced at all so we steamroll everything we've faced and have gone a whole session without taking damage. The most fun I've had is when I made an outlandish plan as a squishier character and ended up getting hit for 80% of my health but still was the only one to take damage that while encounter. 

- the travel takes a thousand years because we diligently travel a few miles, stop, rest, keep watch just to bulldoze yet another initiative fight of 4 wolves or goblins or something

- I like a challenge and I feel like the DM is too afraid of killing someone to remotely challenge us. They'll give out tons of information that's overinforming us about stuff we never see or ask about

I like part of the group, and the DM is really cool and nice, but the whole situation is just super frustrating because I like some of the situation, hate some of the situation, and the DM is pretty cool and nice and I'm sure if given a better dming experience he'd be great so leaving would be tough.",1

I decided to start my own group because I could not find one in my rural town. I would like the opinion of more experienced DM's on the matter. None of the people I initially learned to play with are available due to various commitments.

I am starting a campaign that is based on overthrowing a tyrannical kingdom. All my players are new so I am looking to teach them the mechanics of the game but, in a fun way. Actually playing the game and learning as they go is my plan of action here. I do not want to just throw books at them.

Long story short I am thinking of starting our first session with a massive battle (and part of a larger war of rebels vs kingdom) where the PCs are fighting on the rebel side. The battlespace for the PCs will be small, as it is their own isolated section of this battle, considering they are in the thick of it and I was thinking of throwing 3 waves of various enemies at them. The first 2 waves are going to be intentionally very weak as this is the tutorial of sorts. The 3rd wave is going to include an enemy force that is intentionally unbeatable accompanied by my narration that the battle around them appears lost (If they don't catch the hint I will just outright tell them this time to flee since they are new and may not think to ask if it is possible).

I was hoping to use the battle as a way to give them a crash course in DnD combat but, also to teach them that DnD is not walled in with linear thinking and that fleeing or performing combat in creative ways is possible. The battle is going to be a part of the story as well so it does actually serve a purpose besides being flashy. How does this sound overall? Are there any modifications I should make or perhaps is the whole idea just bad.",1
DnD,p_hopeful,62,"Why and How I Ask for My Player's Triggers (cw: triggers) tldr; A good story for an RPG is one that your players are able to be present for, that's why some people use the X-Card system. A problem with that system, is that it can basically require a DM to rewrite an entire story on the spot. To head off that kind of situation, I made up a list of potentially triggering content for my players to look over and communicate with me about. And here's how I introduce it to them: 

I send this to my players:

&gt;I want the stories we tell in our game to be authentic and powerful, but that requires engaging uncomfortable and difficult aspects of the people and world. I want to make sure that I while I do so, I don't cross any boundaries that prevent you from engaging with the story. But I cannot predict your boundaries, so I need you to send me a list of them.    
&gt;  
&gt;To that end, I attach a list of potentially triggering topics (cw: triggers). There are many things on the list that cross my boundaries, but I wanted to leave as much as possible on it so that ya'll could convey yours. I have, however, left off some of the more egregious topics. Even so, the list is inspecific and incomplete. Please feel free to add new topics or let me know about any specific things that don't fit neatly into a topic. Additionally, I understand that boundaries are more unique than a list of topics can capture. To the degree that you are comfortable, please specify the contexts or ways in which a topic crosses your boundaries (which may be all contexts). For example, graphic animal abuse crosses my boundaries, but keeping animals in cages does not.   
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, I understand that it can be hard to recognize one's boundaries until they are crossed. At any time during the game, I will always prioritize your ability to be present with us over rules, narrative, fun, etc. You can always add things, whenever you realize they cross your boundaries.

Along with the following list. If you have any recommendations for additions please let me know

On reaching the gate a stone giant is on guard duty and the rogue decides to sneak in after they've all been loitering outside the manor gate in full view for several minutes. He succeeds by going around the side using his cloak of arachnid to scale the walls and go across the roof before climbing in a window to the third story. 

Meanwhile the rest of the party talks to the guard and is allowed an audience with the noble. The speak with him about the criminals and he denies knowledge of them, which the party knows is bs after an insight check.

Back to the rogue. He sneaks into the building and through some corridors and finds the rooms where he hears people, not sure who but someone. Goes to the roof again and shimmies down the chimney only to be caught by the idiot of the four siblings making up the criminals they are seeking. Managing to escape before the others notice him he listens as they berate the idiot and leave him to stare at the fireplace. Eventually the rogue comes down again and is face to face with the idiot(an earth genasi healer). Before the idiot can alert the other 3 though he dimension doors behind him and grapples him into unconciousness with no one the wiser. I should clarify here the criminals have 2 rooms and most are in the front room while the rogue and idiot are in the back room.

Escaping out the back window the rogue manages to alert his party members, still talking to the giant noble, of his finds. The party leaves and the rogue is finally caught out on the roof by the guard but manages to convince the stone giant he just likes high places. They all leave.

And immediately go around to the roof above the criminals to attempt to sneak in.  Everyone manages to sneak in except the polymorphed wizard who is behind 2 of his party members and decides cawing as a crow, which he currently is, is the best way to avoid dectection from the bad guy with his back to them still complaining about the unconcious idiot in the corner. He does not know he is unconcious.

The fight ensues. One of the criminals is first and manages to get to the door of the room but is shocked at what she sees taking no action. The wizard is next and polymorphs the first criminal into a slug. Then the flirty sorcerous of the criminals is up, she charms the fighter of our heroes and they wind u making out in the other room, don't ask. The  leader of the criminals is next he attempt to use fire breath but is stopped by the knight's echo summon, protecting the wizard. The alchemist is next and she attacks, wounding the leader. The rogue is next, dashing in to grab the slug and make off with her into the corridor. Last is the one making out with the flirty charmer. She asks him to go fetch her sister and he manages to break out of the charm, pinning her to the bed since they were already grappled.

Back to the top and the wizard demnads the villains surrounder, which the leader does since all the others are incapcitated. Heroes win!

TLDR: party RPs their way into catch criminals with stealth.

DnD,SheriTansorma,8,"[Question/Advice] Ideas to limit cantrip usage? Long story short, I'm planning to run a lowish magic setting. I want to limit cantrips because being able to cast things like Fire Bolt, Gust, Infestation ect an unlimited number of times with zero restrictions doesn't feel very low-magic to me. Note that the average person's HP is 4, so a cleric that can only cast cantrips can just make them spontaneously combust with holy fire, and instantly cremate them from 60 feet away by doing little more than just looking at them. In my opinion, in a world where the existence of magic is a topic of debate among the common folk, even spells as basic as cantrips are a big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't want to fall into the trap of straight-up nerfing spell casters. I still want them to use their cantrips, I just want them to actually give some thought about how and when they use it. Having a limit to how many times they actually use it feels like it'll go a long way to achieving that goal, making it another resource. Maybe sometimes they have to take a risk and open the door or chest themselves. I don't want to force them to open the door themselves, that's not how I wanna GM, I just want them to at least consider if they should. If they use their spells to avoid traps or situations, fantastic, that what they are there for, I would just like for there to be a bit more thought going into the actual usage of said spells, instead of just doing it at any and every opportunity where it would seem convenient. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also running a gritty realism rest rule, so long rests are 1 week. My original idea was to have cantrips be limited to spell casting score (not modifier) + their level times 2. On average, that should be about 18 uses of their cantrips at level 1 before they have to take a week off. However, I'm thinking this might be too harsh? On paper, 18 feels like a lot, but in practice, I'm not certain if that's reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

I really just want a nice balance to make cantrips not free cast spells that they can just spam without any thought or consequence, but not so restrictive it just makes them feel worthless.   


Note, even with this in place, I do plan for any spell caster to eventually become powerful enough to just use their cantrips as many times as they want, but that'll be a quest in of itself. The major theme of my game is growth.",1
DnD,schrockblock,3,"Some of your favorite badass iconic moves? What are some or your favorite **iconic**, **badass** combos/moves for a class, multi-class, and/or race? Here are some examples for inspiration:

**Wizard: Find Familiar + Command**

Command your enemy to drop their weapons, then get your familiar to bring it to you! Great for disarming an enemy, especially if the party has been disarmed themselves.

**Gloom Stalker Assassin: Assassinate + Umbral Sight + Dread Ambush + Zephyr Strike (in the dark)**

A Gloom Stalker in the dark is a force to be reckoned with; on your first turn and with Zephyr Strike, you can quickly do tons of damage with little risk. Add on automatic crits on surprise, and you're doing some major damage.

**Warlock: Darkness + Devil's Sight.**

DnD,Brohoodius,0,"Good idea for a one-shot for my parents? TL:DR, My parents try returning a dragon child back to real parents.

Recently, my parents have heard me talking about the events in the campaign that I'm in with my friends. They have both seemed to take some interest in it because our family loves board games and rolling dice. I told them that I could be the dungeon master for them if they wanted to try it, to which they agreed. I don't have a whole lot of experience with being a DM, but I figure that it'll be alright as long as we all have fun.

When I was reading through the Monster Manual, I took a liking to the lore of silver dragons. I'm a big fan of them befriending humanoids and trying to integrate into society and prefer it over their dragon bodies for the most part. Overall, they just seem to be really happy and social creatures. Also, I read that metallic dragons learn this ability at some point in their lives but it doesn't explicitly specify when even though they don't have the ability until the adult stat block. So in theory, a particularly intelligent younger metallic dragon could learn this ability early in life. Thoughts?

So my idea was that my parents find a human child fly through their house and blowing a huge hole in the side of it. Upon investigation, the child is unscathed but obviously scared and shaken up. More talking, yadda yadda yadda, and they have to go on a journey to deliver the child back to its dragon parents. What do you guys think? Tips?",1

DnD,glxy_HAzor,6,"How the spells Invisibility and Greater Invisibility Work There are many people out there who say that when you are invisible, you have to be blind because no light is hitting your eyes. There might even be DMs out there who apply the blinded condition along with invisibility. This is for those people who aren't satisfied with the ""It's magic"" answer, or those who are interested.

How it works:

Basically, invisibility is not turning yourself invisible, but tricking everyone that would see you into thinking that you aren't there. This would cause the invisible condition because you wouldn't be visible to those creatures, because their minds are tricked into seeing that you aren't there. One reason this is probably true is that the spell is part of the School of Illusion. The Player's Handbook says that ""Illusion spells deceive the minds of others. They cause people to see things that aren't there."" So, the spell is causing people to not see things that are there. If it was making it so that you turned invisible (where no light is reflecting off of you) that would probably be a transmutation spell, as it would be altering the properties of yourself.

This is why the 2nd level invisibility spell wears off after you attack or cast a spell. It's because the creature's mind is being forced to recognize you are there because it was attacked by you, kind of like how a creature can tell that most illusions are fake by interacting with it. For greater invisibility, the spell probably is forcing other creatures not to process that you are there, like how Phantasmal Killer forces creatures to believe it is seeing its worst fears, which makes the creature take damage.

What do you think of this theory? I know the flair is 5th edition because it is talking about 5th edition spells, but it can apply to an invisibility spell in any edition.",1

Let me know what you think! Any constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated.

Blood Magic - A Sorcerous Origin

Lv 1 - Hemorrhaging Wound - You use your magic to pull blood out of a bleeding creature, making the wound more volatile. When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage from an attack or spell that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to place a wound on that creature. At the start of the creature‚Äôs next turn, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each wound on it. At the end of its turn it can make a Constitution Saving Throw against your spell DC, removing all wounds on it. Additionally an adjacent creature can use an action to attempt a medicine check against your spell DC to remove all wounds on the targeted creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Lv 1 - Sanguine Enhancement - Your magic connection to blood strengthens your life force, you can also pull magical power by draining yourself of energy. Your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
Additionally, when you gain access to the Font of Magic feature, you can choose to spend a number of hit die no more than half of your level rounded down when you finish a short rest. You then regain a number of sorcery points equal to the number of hit dice spent. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

Lv 6 - Metabolic Enhancement - You touch a creature reenforcing its blood to give it extra strength. You can use an action to expend 3 sorcery points to give you or another creature within 5 ft of you one of the following benefits for the next 10 minutes:
Advantage on Strength Checks
Advantage on Constitution Saving Throws
Resistant to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition

Lv 14 - Bloodbend - You have mastered the ability to freeze a creature's blood, holding them in place. You learn the Hold Monster if you did not already know it. This spell does not count against the number of spells you know. You can cast this spell by expending a spell slot or by expending 6 sorcery points. When you cast it using sorcery points the spell has the following changes.
The target makes a constitution saving throw instead of a wisdom saving throw.
The spell can affect any creature as long as it has blood. A creature automatically succeeds its saving throw if it has no blood.
If the target is below half of its maximum hit points rounded down, then it has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Lv 18 - Hematurgy Storm - You have fully mastered the art of blood magic. You can now use your enemies‚Äô bodies to unleash a maelstrom of blood. On your turn, after you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action to cause it to explode in a storm of blood. You can only use this feature if the creature has blood in its body. 
When the creature explodes it creates a storm of blood that is a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the creature that last for 1 minute. Creatures inside the sphere are heavily obscured. Any creature that starts its turn inside the storm takes 2d10 necrotic damage and if it has blood in its body must make a constitution saving throw against your spell DC or be restrained. Any creature with blood in its body that starts its turn within 20 ft of the sphere must make a strength saving throw or be pulled 10 ft closer to the center of the sphere.
You can end the affect of the sphere as a bonus action on a subsequent turn.",1

DnD,Art_And_Cooking,0,"[OC][ART][5e] Morgana Gailbraith Some art I created of my tiefling red dragon blooded sorcerer. The other members of the party include a halfling rogue named Favrielle Muchale, Roscoe The Rabid (a halfing barbarian), and Pell Mhandyvver the human ranger. 

The game was set in the Forgotten Realms. The party was ambushed by a white dragon while traveling along the sword coast, and ended up in Red Larch. Favrielle was a tailor as part of caravan traveling to sell her wears, and buy some exotic fabrics. He life long friend Morgana decided to join her. (Partly because she was laying low after picking the wrong pockets) Rosceo was hided as muscle to guard the caravan. They met Pell in Red Larch, a native to the town. She was a wide eyed and bushy tailed lass with dreams of becoming an adventure. 

The group ended up adventuring around the town, and made their way down into the underdark. Thinks went south, and because of Morgana's choices the party got captured, and Pell got sold to an Illithid. They managed to escape, and made their way back to the surface to re-supply, with plans to find Pell and save her. That also went south. The picked up a dwarf fighter named Snagger to aid them on their quest. After successfully clearing out den of Grell, they got ambushed by a Behir in another cavern that got the drop on Favrielle. It threatened the party, and after a botched intimidate by Morgana, Favrielle got cut into two. They fraught off the Behir and it fled. They found the den, and recovered a sizable amount of treasure. Recovering Favrielles body, they force marched back to Red Larch. After returning they asked around in the hopes of finding someone able to bring her back from the dead. They got directed to a circle of druids, and set up to bring Favrielle back, and then to try and save Pell.

So Morgana keeps making poor decisions. Having demon and dragon blood tends to make her rash, brash, and hot headed. This trait has bit her in the butt many time, and unfortunate it get those she cares about hurt the most.

3. Recommend any good ways to play/track stuff online so I can start making progress towards involving friends without travel. 

Thank you folks!",1

DnD,imakunei,4,"[5e] Prestidigitation Tattoo Question  

Just another chat about good ol' Prestidigitation! I'm mostly just looking for how people would run this very small scenario in their campaign if it would come up and they were the DM (yes or no, and what would be their reasoning, be it they like to read RAW text or whatev).

One of your players (Player A) puts two other players (Players B and C) under sedation, via nefarious means, and gets them tattooed by a professional tattoo artist (or the Forgotten Realms equivalent of such a thing). The tattoo ink is a normal, everyday ink you would find irl. The tattoo signifies them as someone important to Player A's gang, even though neither B nor C are actually in the gang; a sort of, ""Don't touch these two"", kind of warning. Players B and C later decide they do not want to be associated with Player A, so Player B (a sorcerer) wishes to use Prestidigitation to permanently remove the tattoo, via Prestidigitation's cleaning effect, from both of them.

Would you allow this very minor usage of Prestidigitation (even though it may technically have a large impact on future interactions with NPCs) or not and why. Keep in mind the tattoo in question is in no way magical. It is just an ordinary ink.

Thanks for your time. I've already read a number of posts arguing the natures of some of Prestidigitation's debatable, vague description. Feel free to discuss further why YOU would allow it in YOUR campaign and what allowing it might mean for future applications of Prestidigitation in other, similar scenarios. Or if you wouldn't allow it, why not, why you think it would harm your game session to allow it, and what alternatives you might suggest to your players.",1

Looking to get tarot cards created of my D&amp;D part of 3 years. But alas, I have no artistic talent. Would be 6 in total (5 characters &amp; DM). Wondering if any artists out there would be interested!",1
DnD,WhiteRabbitWeirdo,4,"New to DMing and I want advice on some things in my one-off I'm working on.  (I really hope none of my players see this, because I know at *least* one of them is in this subreddit, but I don't really have anywhere else to ask because the other place I asked no one is really being helpful.)

I'm planning on running a one-off campaign with some online friends. I have never DMed before and I'm sort of using this as a test to see whether or not I think I'll be able to handle writing and running an actual campaign.

My goal in this post is that I'm basically just looking for some advice on what I currently have planned out, mostly trying to see if it would ""realistically"" work in D&amp;D 5e. (And just saying, I have a lot of questions/things I want to get opinions on so this might be sort of long.)

The one-off I'm running is based on The Thunderlock Barcrawl from issue one of Rolled &amp; Told, but I'm heavily modifying it to make it suit my style better. I'm basically turning it into an escape room with some fighting/more intense moments thrown in.

First is that as one of the puzzles I want there to be a room that has Major Illusion cast on it to make it appear like there's a gelatinous cube in the center of the room with the key to get out of that specific room inside of it. (1) Would it be too easy for the players to figure out it isn't really there due to the nature of Major Illusion? (2) If so, I'm debating on making the pedestal the key is actually sitting on trapped in some way but I'm not sure what type of trap would be best? A magical trap, a trap that unleashes something for them to fight, etc. (Keeping in mind that this is ran underground beneath a tavern.)

After the gelatinous cube room and the room adjacent to it (which isn't really that important here) is a room with ten chests in it and nothing else. One has the key to go to the next room, one is a mimic, one will just have trash in it (crumpled and torn parchment, old food, etc.), and the rest will either just be empty or have an item in it that the player can take with them. (3) My question with this is, what are some good non-magical or low level magic items to include in the chests.

After the chest room is one last actual room where the players will fight something that has the key somewhere on it. (4) Suggestions for a creature or small group of creatures for 5 level 5 pcs to fight would be appreciated.

And finally after that is the final room that they will leave from and return to the bar to receive their prize. In the original version of the campaign there's an arcane giant rat generator and seven doors to choose from to attempt to leave. However I thought it would be more fun just to mentally screw with the players minds rather than making them fight a randomly generated number of giant rats.

My idea was that the room is empty other than a sign on the wall (which there will be signs in some of the other rooms as well to make it seem less out of place) and a metal door that has an elevator of sorts behind it to take them back upstairs. The sign will say something along the lines of ""Thank you for attending the Thunderlock Barcrawl and congratulations on making it to the end. Use your final key on the door and you'll be free to go."" However in reality the sign has either illusory script or minor illusion (haven't decided yet) on it and actually says something along the lines of ""Thanks for attending and congratulations, lift sign to press the button for the elevator."" The door is going to be resistant to fire and magic as well. (5) Is that too mean of a thing to do to my players? Should I change it back to something along the lines of the original or just go with what I came up with?

The original campaign has a 2 hour time limit to receive the prize but I'm thinking of making it closer to 2 and half or 3 hours, because I've only ever seen one group run it online and it took them almost 4-4 and a half hours to complete the original version. Not sure on the exact time limit I want to put yet.

I'm afraid that with the whole solve the puzzle/fight the thing and then retrieve the key to move on to the next room and repeat thing would be way too repetitive. (6) Do you think I added enough variety to make it seem not as repetitive as it is?

(7) My final question is, how important is it that the DM 100% follows the rules for not only their players but themselves as well?

I'm not going to make my players have to prepare spells or use spell components, and if they have a clever idea to use mage hand attack or carry over 10 pounds I'm not going to tell them no. Having said that, if I'm lax on the rules for players does that make it okay for me to ignore small portions of rules for spells and such as well as long as I let my players do it? (For example how in the room I didn't mention I want to use magic mouth on a statue to give my players a riddle but ignore the ""it must be 25 words or less"" bit.)

More so just curious in general for that last question, I believe the example I gave is the only instance I plan on actually doing it in this one-off.

Anyway, thank you in advance for any advice or recommendations anyone gives me.

TL;DR: I'm new to DMing but I want to run a one off for some friends and I have a bunch of questions/things I want advice/recommendations on, which you can find with the (number).",1

DnD,Turret_Run,0,"Help making a Kamen Rider class So I'm in college and had an awesome roommate over the last year. I wanted to make a gift to say thanks and two things he loves are Kamen Rider and D&amp;D so I thought I could combo the two for something awesome. I've homebrewed a race before and thought a class would be about as hard was proven very, very wrong. I'd really appreciate any support/advice from both people who've made classes and Kamen Rider fans for cool ideas!

So so far the basic idea is that it's  form of utility/DPS class. In normal mode, you get martial arts proficiency, and your AC is equal to dexterity+charisma. You'd get initial drives(keys? totems? the transformation component), and get more from beating monsters that are your CR or stronger, then passing a sort of harnessing check based on the CR. The abilities would be in the same sort of field as eldritch invocations or magic items, providing limited access to spells/feats, changing damage type, possible damage boosts, etc. When you transform (limited to a certain number of times a day) you'd have a minor damage boost (max +3), and you could be transformed for a minute. You'd finish up trnaofmarion by performing rider kick, which would basically be an automatic crit on the enemy, and then force you to de-transform.  

the things I was thinking so far for later levels were things like quick change, upgraded forms at a certain point., and as you beat stronger monsters you can add more infusions to a drive or add stronger ones. 

Subclasses so far are mostly just the two series I've watched, Build and Zero One. The build is focused on combing weaker infusions into stronger ones, and also being able to give an ally minor bonuses (and maybe some intelligence boosts). Zero One has a stronger focus on diverse weapon drives, and expertise or two. 

the main issues I'm having are making more flavor level skills, the kinds of drive infusions that would be a good idea, and tips for making sure I create a class that feels like you're a rider but also isn't overpowered. Any advice and recommendations are appreciated!",1

So this is something that many people might not find interesting, but I can't stop thinking of the fun I had Saturday night. I never really had a group to play DnD with, so my friends who have their own campaign with a few other people, came and asked if I wanted to join in a one shot.
I of course said absolutely.

Saturday night at around midnight we all gathered on Roll20 for a rundown for my cousin and I, as this was his first time rolling for a character, and my first real rolling. Once my Shadar-Kai Ranger was made, I was so stoaked for this upcoming week's one shot. 

My buddy wanted to practice being a DM, and using Roll20 for the first time, wanted to do a test combat scenario as also a way to show us the ropes. That hour long test run with my 4 closest friends, taking on 5 goblins and their leader in a cave was so much fun. 

I definitely need to learn more about my class, and learn some tips here and there to my things easier for me, but this weekend gave me one of the best nights I've had in a long time. I cannot hold my excitement any longer for this one shot!

DnD,Shadow-Zero,10,"Optimizing the master of moments epic destiny from 4e: Summoner Druid Over the years, I made and read many char optimization builds for D&amp;D 4e but I've never seen one that made good use of master of moments. Long Story short, the main benefit from this ED comes from it's level 21 feature: You can spend an action point to gain a standard + move + minor action instead of just one extra action. Also, it's level 24 feature gives you an extra minor action per round + the ability to convert two minor actions into a move one if you wish.

So, the best way to create a super optimized character with this ED is by having ways to attack many times using minor actions. And I find that the Druid class is a premier pick for this by using this build:

What makes this build possible and devastating is the epic tear feat, Primal Summoning Expertise. It allows you to use a minor action to give a standard action command to your Primal Summons. The paragon path is also focused on summoning, giving you a standard action command to your summon as a free action when you spend an action point. The lvl 11 encounter gives extra damage to your summons attacks and the daily lvl 20 is another (and good) summon. The feat Primal Resurgence lets you regain the use of a primal daily power once a day when you get bloodied.

So, starting at level 21, you will have one summon daily per encounter (assuming 5 encounters a day) and for the encounters you use an action point, you get 4 extra actions out of it that can all be used for attacking. At lvl 24 you get an extra minor action per round and near the end of the adventure,  at lvl 29, the ring of free time gives you another minor action per encounter/ per round after a milestone. That's 3 standards + 2 moves + 2-4 minors when you action point.

The cherry on top is that the Druid also has some of the best summons of all 4th Edition. The best one being the lvl 25 Writhing Henge,which should be the one you get an extra use per day. It summons 6 tendrils with reach. They are limited to each attacking a different enemy on your standard action command, but it's intrinsic effect (When you don't give it any command on your turn) can make them all focus fire a single target. The intrinsic effect is balanced around the fact you are forced to give the standard attack command as part of the summon (So it can only activate the following turn, maybe) but this build can work around that. 

The level 10 daily utility (Animal Clan) allows you to once per round use a minor action to force your summon to use it's intrinsic effect, essentially giving you an Hexa attack per round. The master of moments ED also has a level 26 utility that let's you freeze a target in time until the end of your next turn after you hit it. Summon the tendrils against a solo+ attack a few times with one of them + freeze the target in time +give no commands to the tendrils next turn = They all attack on their own the moment the enemy leaves the time stasis.

The other Summons you will keep in your final build include the Lightning Drake (has AOE ataccks), your paragon path daily that constantly shifts and changes sizes when you command it to attack and either the storm behemoth for more AOE attacks or the Elder pack wolf that annoys a single target more.

This build uses the frost cheese combo of a frost weapon + the feats lasting frost and wintertouched  in order to get permanent combat advantage + some extra damage. The Sarifal Feywarden theme ups your damage even further with an encounter aura 2 that gives enemies 5/10/15 vulnerability to your attacks of a chosen element until the end of your next turn. Great for nova turns and gives + 1 power bonus fortitude.

Although This build is certainly late game oriented (Even better if the adventure is starting at epic tier), it is still useful early. The druid has several powers that damage and hinder multiple targets, including encounter powers that dominate the target as early as level 7 and some excellent non summoning dailies like wall of thorns. And the fire hawk at will power gives you temporary threatening reach against te victim, all but guaranteing a second attack when the target moves or attacks. The initial stats ensure you can take feats like light shield proficiency in paragon and second skin in early epic + other shield related feats to patch your weaker fortitude defense.

I hope druid players and fans of character optimization in general enjoy this. I also have two variations of this build: A Druid - Artificer and Druid - Bard hybrids that I'll post later.",1

DnD,glxy_HAzor,8,"Sniper - A 5th Edition Fighter Subclass I put this on D&amp;D beyond - Link is here: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/389063-sniper](https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/389063-sniper)

This is the subclass:

Snipers excel at picking off enemies from long range. They are able to easily figure out where to hit a creature to hurt it most, and prefer using one large attack over a series of smaller attacks. Snipers prefer the bow and arrow because of how far the arrows go. Snipers usually serve as scouts and assassins.

#### Sniper

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the perception skill and the following benefits:¬†

* You can choose to take a -5 penalty to your attack roll with a shortbow or longbow to gain a +10 bonus to the damage.
* You don‚Äôt have disadvantage against enemies at long range if they aren‚Äôt behind cover.

#### Careful Shots

Starting at 7th level, you can easily shoot at a creature‚Äôs weak spots. You can choose to move last in the initiative order on your turn. When you take the attack action on your turn, if you are last in the initiative order, you can forgo your extra attack(s) to multiply the damage of your attack with a shortbow or longbow by 1 + the number of extra attacks you have. If you do this, you gain a bonus to the attack roll equal to your dexterity modifier.

#### Focus Fire

Starting at 10th level, you are able to perfectly hit shots if you spend enough time aiming. You can take a special action to take aim at a creature on your turn. When you take this action, if you do nothing else on your turn, your next attack with a shortbow or longbow will not miss that creature if that creature is still in your line of sight and not behind three-quarters or full cover.

#### True Strikes

Starting at 15th level, you can aim faster than most people. As a bonus action on your turn, you choose a creature within the normal range of your shortbow or longbow. You gain advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your perception modifier. (Minimum 1) You regain all uses after a short or long rest.

#### Peerless Aim

Starting at 18th level, you can focus your senses so that you can unfailingly detect a creature‚Äôs vulnerabilities. As a bonus action, you can focus your senses and gain the following benefits for one minute:

* You add your perception modifier to damage rolls of your shortbow or longbow.
* You can use your careful shots without going last in the initiative order.
* You have advantage on ranged attack rolls

Once you use this trait, you must take a short or long rest before you can use it again.",1

This is a story of a young wizard left with little to nothing in a possibly wind goose chase. Thank You in advance for reading my quite lenghty post and for any comments you might want to leave.

Grayson Withersong 

Grayson was born to a half-orcish scientist and presumably human mother, since he never even knew her. He didn‚Äôt even know if she was alive. He grew up in the countryside of Grellreach in a modest home atop of a hill.¬† 

His emotionally distant, Phineas Withersong, was a scientist and a practitioner of the arcane arts. He was well known in the neighboring towns for his wits and skills, but for some reason he didn‚Äôt want his son following his footsteps so he never allowed him access to his office which was filled with a vast collection of books and tomes. Gray‚Äôs father was mostly away from home, so Gray was raised by an old family friend, a half-elf Varis Silverkin. Varis‚Äô daughter, was a girl of a thin frame, long blonde hair and emerald eyes. She was the same age as Gray so the two were each other‚Äôs playmates as long for as long as they could remember. 

As Gray approached his teen years he started sneaking into his father‚Äôs old office and discovered that, just like his father, he was very talented for arcane arts and alchemy while pouring through his old books. By the time he was 18everyone in his little town knew him as a really smart kid with a bright future. In all those years the last time he saw or heard of his father was about 11 years old. It was like he just disappeared. 

The constant praise for his talents from his adoptive family and townsfolk, unfortunately, led Gray to becoming a bit too full of himself. He decided he would start practicing spells that were way out of his league. One night he snuck out of Varis‚Äô house, as per usual, and made his way to his father‚Äôs office and took the tome that was chained to the wall of the room. He quickly began the process of casting a spell from the tome in order to test it out. Blue and black smoke filled the chamber as the bolts of crackling energy emanated from what looked like a tiny black hole in the air. He frantically flipped through the pages to see which step comes next... But the pages were empty. Impossible. He could have sworn he read the spell beforehand. He didn‚Äôt know what to do. The smoke grew thicker and the energy outbursts became more powerful. The spell was unstable. He turned away to shield his eyes from the immanent blast, but as he turned, he saw Thia standing at the door, watching in fear as the bright light filled the room and then... 

Silence. 

Raindrops. 

Grayson could only feel soft raindrops hitting his skin as he slowly opened his eyes. One third of his father‚Äôs house was destroyed, and Thia was gone.¬† 

There was no rubble, or blood. Only the caster remained, it seemed, with the book in his hands as the searing pain rolled across his back and arms leaving black scars from the spell‚Äôs whiplash. 

He told Varis what happened, but the man was so devastated, resenting Grayson telling him never to return. So Gray packed his things and left to live a life of seclusion. Eventually he decided trying to atone for his hubris and set of to try and find a way to undo his errors.",1

DnD,Hexygonical,2,"[5e] My Party Created an Ethereal Hag, How Should it Torment Them? TL;DR: Interaction between the spells *Blink* and *Polymorph* allowing the party to trap the hag they were fighting into the Ethereal Plane. Now I have to figure out how it will forever torment them.

This is a wild story I felt like I had to share as DM for my group. I also would love to hear about how long I can expect the hag to survive, some things she can do while being ethereal, and if this ruling was actually correct.

# Story Time

The party had found the secret underwater sahuagin base created right underneath the Elven capital island. An attack from the sahuagin was planned to happen in three days, but because of their efforts, the elven guards launched a preemptive attack on the lair, and told the party to go directly to the second floor and kill the leader to stop the attack from happening.

After descending on the back of a blue whale, solving some puzzles, and interrupting a ritual that was keeping a bubble shield around the leader's throne room, there they found the leader of the sahuagin, a Sea Fury (more buffed version of a sea hag, comes from Wildemount). Alongside the hag was an NPC they had been assigned a bounty for, and thus a boss battle ensued. The Sea Fury used *Fear* and legendary actions to frighten enemies alongside the NPC's Paladin auras to have disadvantage on checks against getting frightened, making it all the easier to use Death Gaze and drop party members instantly.

It was also found out that she had immunities to fire, cold, and even non-silvered weapons. Most of the other targets in the room had been taken care of, but the Sea Fury stood nearly untouched. However, during this time the party had been whittling away her legendary resistances, and as a meme my party has been enjoying recently, the druid turned the Sea Fury into a clam. They then begin yelling at each other for someone to pick her up and keep her from reverting. Just then, the artificer of the group who had cast *Blink* returns to the Material Plane, picks up the clam, then blinks back to the Ethereal Plane.

Everyone is happy, but one person asks ""Wait, can she just drop the clam in the Ethereal Plane and leave it there?"" I thought for a moment saying ""Mechanically no, you teleport at the very end of your turn and then at the very beginning of your next turn, so you don't have time to drop an item."" Everyone laughed the thought off and agreed it would've been an effective tactic.... 

Until the druid said ""What if I drop concentration on *Polymorph*?""

What followed was the druid simply dropping concentration, the hag stumbling out of the artificer's pocket into the Ethereal Plane, and the artificer blinking back to the Material Plane to leave the hag there.

Boss battle averted.

# The Oh-So-Fun Consequences

After the session ended and they leveled up for defeating the boss and collecting the bounty, we began discussing what would've happened to the hag. At the time I thought you couldn't breathe in the Ethereal Plane, but if that was true *Blink* would make you suffocate, and sure enough going into the Ethereal Plane turns you ethereal and you can breathe ethereal air.... so the hag is still alive.

In fact, the hag would be watching the party still, since you can see the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane. She would be furious with them, and immediately begin going into survival mode trying to get out of the Ethereal Plane. After much research, I concluded hunger and thirst are very real things while in the Ethereal Plane, and in a plane of ghosts and spiritual creatures it's rare to find food and water. She most likely will die within a few days. But of course I can't let that happen, this is way too amazing of an opportunity to screw with my party.

So, I thank you if you've read this far, and now I ask for your help in deciding how the hag could possibly live for long enough to get back at the party and/or torment them from the Ethereal Plane. The artificer sure as hell can't use *Blink* anytime soon, because the hag be waiting and attack, but otherwise, what can she do?",1

DnD,SpliterCbb,8,"How to deal with an intermittent player in the story? Hello!  
I'm DM-ing for 4 players, however one of them often can't make it. It doesn't always happens, but it's often enough that it is a bit of a problem.

Just to be clear, he has good enough reasons to not be able to participate, and in terms of our games we decided that if he can't join at the last minute then we just play without him, and it seems everyone's fine with that arrangement. None of us wants to kick him out, and he enjoys the game, but he has other responsibilities, which is fine.

The issue for me however is that I run a story-oriented adventure, and I'm having trouble dealing with the character itself. We already trying leaving the character behind, but that has caused us some major issues several times already by my fumbled attempts to re-introduce him in a way that fits the story. On the other hand, having his character run with the party while he's unavailable means someone has to do double-shift running a character they're not very familiar with (and I definitely can't do it, I'm already overwhelmed with running the game).

We're doing the Greenest campaign, with the dragon cult and all that. 

Our DM gave us backstory outlines and I got this one: ""Being the grandchild of a renowned dragon slayer is usually a good way to impress people, but just last week a gang of ruffians attack you. You barely escaped with your life, but as you fled, the ruffians told you that the Cult of the Dragon never forgets and always avenges. You‚Äôre hoping to lie low in a sleepy little town called Greenest until this blows over."" (I'm assuming these are pre-made from the book).

Given all that, I'm going to be a wood elf that I grew up in a medium sized village somewhat off the main path. Not so small as to be passed by, but not to large that my family wouldn't have been drowned out by all the goings-on of a larger city, where they could use that history to their benefit, not sure where that would be though. I'm thinking that my family had always been encouraging me to not leave the town (not outright, but always saying how there's no reason to leave and such) but I finally decided to leave and be a merchant sailor (or any other as well) around 40 (since elves live to like 250?) as it seemed to easiest way to see as much of the world as possible and to see what my family must've been hiding from me since they never wanted me to leave. Sorta ""teen"" rebelliousness. I'm not sure where that could have taken me, but I figure at the start of the campaign (maybe 20-40 years later?) I've taken the job as a caravan guard due to the beating that cult members gave me on shore leave one time and decided to go elsewhere to make myself scarce, as it's the first time that my family history has been detrimental for me. I didn't bother telling anyone about my family when I was a sailor cause there was no need, and I rarely made lasting friends due to the transient nature of work, and the fact that it's been so long since I've even thought about that part of my family's history (or maybe I should have one person who knows?).

Writing it all out it seems like a lot, but still feels very vague. I'm also going to be a monk, given the tons of physical labor by hand and time to be alone on voyages. 

Any and all help is appreciated. Think I picked the right flair. Thanks!",1

In the last campaign I was in, I found a treasure chest and inside were the usual mundane items and then two daggers, one an infinidagger (creates daggers to be thrown as long as you‚Äôre holding on to the original) and a prismatic dagger. I was so excited to have these, however we are an early campaign and have yet to purchase things like a sack or bag of holding, so we placed it on the chest of our necormancer‚Äôs skeleton, joking around that it has Madonna traffic cone breasts.

During a battle our Pscion trapped an ever dividing and replicating swarm into a room with the skeleton and set fire into it till basically the swarm was to suffocate or die from too much expansion in a small area (didn‚Äôt work out they destroyed the wall he created too) anyways fire got to hot and dm rolled to see if the daggers survived, they didn‚Äôt.

After we survived the horde and stopped the spell creating them, I hit both the necromancer (he helped with the fire) and the pscion with what remained of the hilts.

At the start I were thinking to stick to the plan and stay a pure Warlock but the events of the campaign give me the idea that maybe he could succeed, sort of. So I think to multiclass in Sorcerer but it's my first character, I'm not sure of the viability.

The campaign begins with an angel and a demon fighting in the sky. The demon will cast down the angel and fly away. The angel will crash to earth and the party will investigate.

As for the world building: There was once a great war between the angels and demons. Asmodeus and his 9 Generals vs Seraphim and him army of angels. Through a mysterious method the demons poured out of hell and invaided the mortal plain and earth. The angels suffered heavy casualties; as for the demons they only grew in numbers as they return to hell upon death and create lemures from evil mortals they have slain. From the essence left behind by Asmodeus; Seraphim closed hell of permanently. Fearing his defeat Asmodeus hid his newborn daughter in the mortal plain. He is able to contact her and influence her to find the legendary artifact the Key of Realms. She is extremely powerful but due to not being raised in the fires of hell she is almost more human than demon. She loves to dance and often shows mercy to mortals but never to angels as they would never do the same to her. The angel from the beginning was transporting the Key of Realms to a new location; as they change location from time to time. Asmodus's daughter intercepts it from the angel. Seraphim had gotten complacent and began ignoring demon activities perceiving them as a non threat. 

That's it for now. Again any suggestions are welcome and appreciated!",1

* If you beat the house for the round, the number you won with is your ability score. Highest total at the table for the round adds 1 to their score.

* If you lose against the house for the round, your score is the difference between the total of your cards subtracted from the total of the house's cards. The player with the lowest total for the round doubles the difference for calculation.

* If you bust, at the end of the round, check against the card last dealt to each player and the dealer's revealed card. The lowest of these is your score. (Ace is considered high). 


Bonus Rule: Class Selection

You may play a bonus 7th round either before or after the rounds to determine ability scores, depending on how you are assigning them.  

* If you beat the house in this round, choose any of the cards you have been dealt and select the class corresponding to the card, listed below.

* If you lose to the house this round, your class corresponds to the last card you were dealt.

* If you bust in this round, the house decides your class according to what they believe your stats will be least suited to. This will be selected after those have been determined, if they have not already.

DnD,Goldigger21,6,"Why PotA receives so much hate? Hello guys! There are spoilers here about Princes of the Apocalypse obviously so beware!

I have seen that PotA have received a lot of criticism here and while it has its flaws (like forcing the party to endlessly clean dungeons to destroy the cult) it has an interesting story that allows you to use it's sandboxy to nature to introduce tha players to factions' politics, Yartar's mafia, the Kraken Society and many others. Plus it provides with a great megadungeon that even if you think it's a little too much you can always use it partially in order to give your players a 2-3 sessions sidequest, like using the Water Cult as a mini villain for a 6 level party and have them investigate + clean the Riverguard Keep and their Temple. It also has an epic boss fight where they fight an elemental prince.

I have a lot of fun running it for my party and I am close to the end. We started using the Zhentarim background of a PC to turn them into their mascots after a couple victories and arrests against the cults' bandits and we even made a fixed tournament in Triboar to promote the Zhentarim guy. In the end one rakhsasa ended up replacing a high-ranked Zhentarim agent who escorts the Mirabar delegation back home (is he? ;) ) and the party starts to form its own mercenary company.

So, do you agree or disagree that it deserves a little more love, plus how do you suggest to continue after I finish it? I was thinking about having the Rakhsasa trying to start a war by murdering the Mirabarians so it can force Mirabar and Zhentarim to fight while he runs away and have the PCs deal with Zhentarim infighting as it is shown in Dragon Heist.",1

DnD,savethejunimos,7,"My Fighter15/Rogue3 /Barbarian2 Character! I am doing a level 20 oneshot soon and I just thought I would share my character with you all because I found a quite cool build.

I am **Thotham Thunderstrike** a male Half-Elf fighter/rogue/barbarian 

Fighter: Samurai - Rogue: Mastermind

Stats:

Strength: (originally 18) 20     Constitution: (originally 16) 20      Dexterity: 13   Intelligence: (Originally 14) 16       Wisdom: 14     Charisma: 11

Hp: 197 ( The DM decided our hp due to our characters so he could scale stuff accordingly)

Feat: Elven Accuracy

**Important Stuff**

Barbarian: Rages 2 - Rage Damage +2 - Reckless Attack - 

Rogue: Sneak attack - Cunning action - Eyes for detail (Mastermind) -

Fighter: Extra Attack (2) - Indomitable (2) - Two Weapon Fighting (Fighting Style) - Action Surge - Fighting Spirit - Tireless Spirit - Rapid Strike (All Samurai) -

The reason this is important is what i will show you in an example:

I am fighting something (It doesn't really matter). I have 2 daggers which are finesse (which can use strength) and melee. I use The thing you like about samurai is the rapid strike. (If you have advantage on an attack you can forgo the advantage to make another attack once per turn) I use reckless attack. I forgo the advantage. I can now attack 4 times. One of which doesn't have advantage. (Lets assume all attacks hit) I will use sneak attack on one of them and use my bonus action to attack again with two weapon fighting or rage for extra damage. 4d4 + 2d6 + 20 +1d4 +5 or 8 points of rage damage. Another turn possibility: I use my bonus action to do fighting spirits to gain advantage on all 4 attacks ( i forgo advantage on one) 4d4 + 2d6 + 20 + 10 temp hp. (On average 34 points of damage and 10 points of healing). Also it is very likely to hit because of elven accuracy.

It is not as good as other builds which are simpler but i just thought it would be fun to do.

tldr: Gain advantage multiple ways. Sneak Attack, Rage, Reckless Attack roll dice for advantage out of your ass. deal damage.",1

DnD,MapStrikesAgain,3,"Azgaar Fantasy Map Generator: the best world building tool i've come across so far The [Azgaar Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/)

at first glance may come across as just a world generator like Dojon and Worldspinner(two great tools, don't get me wrong), but if you take your time mastering the options it offers, azgaars can be a very powerful map making and world building tool to have in your arsenal.

when the app loads [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/2FWckyM)

is the first thing you will see: a newly generated map and the [options bar in the layers settings](https://imgur.com/gallery/pD6fa3L)

if you explore around you will see that all it does is toggle on/off the visibility of things. if you just want a world made from scratch this is already very good, but if you trying to translate a idea that you already have this can be a lot of very confusing stuff that you don't know what is for.

So i advise you to go to the [options tab](https://imgur.com/gallery/6NpUsuq)

, there you going to find some personalization options:

* **canvas size:** its automatically programed to fit-to-window but you can always change it
* **seed:** the magic numbers that randomize worlds
* **points:** define detail
* **name:** do i really have to explain that?
* **template\*:** very important! it defines the shape of your map(i like to use mediterranean to regional maps and pangea to worlds)
* **cultures:** defines the number and the details of that sweet thing called diversity.(it also defines the names generates with the culture specific tool)
* the other ones are very self explanatory, besides size variation that is just for size inequality between nations

remember create a new map after defining the settings

by now you probably have a world much more similar to what you wished. BUT IF YOU STILL WANT MORE... [the tool tab](https://imgur.com/gallery/FkIU9pF)

. it has 4 sections:

* **configure:** it has some very detailed editable tables, and in some of them there is an brush(manually re-assign) tool, for further customization.  

   * in this section you find the heightmap tool, with it you can shape the world however you want, creating mountain, plains, islands, editing the coastline.
* **overview:** get more detailed info
* **regenerate:** re-assign stuff based on the current definitions
* **add:** manually add things to your map

And last, but not least the [style tab](https://imgur.com/gallery/CH5pMdG)

in it you can apply filters, edit colours, change fonts, and all that bzaz. just go in select element and choose what you want to change. if you don't want to change everything by hand you can use the presets.

this is getting rly long so with you want to know more check out the [quick start tutorial](https://github.com/Azgaar/Fantasy-Map-Generator/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial)

on azgaar's github and Azgaar's subreddit [r/FantasyMapGenerator](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyMapGenerator/)

I've never played the game, only watched some actual play shows so I'm not familiar enough with most of the niche spells and interactions to create this setting on my own.

The jist of it is this: i want to have a deity who's created a fake city that's designed to make the pc's want to stay there. The whole city is a giant illusion and all the characters are under some sort of charm or spell (domonate persons, illusion spells, etc.) that makes them unable to realize it (until they eventually break free). 

The PC's may eventually battle the deity so I don't want to make the deity a literal unkillable god (I'm thinking a level 20 wizard who's mastered the schools of Abjuration, Conjuration, Enchantment, Illusion, AND Transmutation).

How could I explain this within the confines of the rulebook (or atleast close enough to it)? Should the deity be the source of ALL the illusion magic, or perhaps a hidden network of controlled npc's working collectively (i.e. pyramid scheme)? Something else that I haven't thought of yet?

DnD,Hierogriff,29,"The law of the city: You must leave with less wealth than when you entered. How does this affect the economy? More details:

The city is ruled by a mad beholder, who sees the city, its population, and its wealth as his hoard. A council of nobles handles the boresome details of ruling, as long as the hoard continues to expand. To do this, the law is that anyone who leaves the city must do so with less wealth than when they entered, even if the difference is a copper piece.

How would this affect the economy and culture of the city? Bonus points for things the  party could do to abuse this system. Would love to hear from the collective creativity of you all! Here are some concepts I've considered:

\- Getting in and out of the city is a bureaucratic hassle, as your entire inventory is processed, gold counted, magical items appraised, etc. Paperwork is kept, but the gate agents have a direct stone line to the beholder's earpiece, and just describe everything that goes in/out. The beholder's memory is infinite, and recognises when the law is broken.

\- Everyone who comes here has to leave some property, so they open bar tabs for when they next return. This kind of behaviour escalates until a good deal of your wealth is tied up with the city, so you may as well move there. So the city expands...

\- Getting in/out is a frightful bore, so nobles don't usually leave. The city park is big enough to accommodate the hunting ect. rich folks might like to do.

\- A major activity of the thieves' guild is smuggling... people out of the city with their property.

Currently I'm running a homebrew take on Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus, and I'm wanting to use the Helm of Torm's sight to give the party visions of possible futures, one where they choose Good and are uncorrupted by Avernus, and another where they give in to the evils of the plane and can potentially take the Throne of Avernus for themselves, to clarify their motivations and give hints of some things to come. My real query is how best to do this.

Initially I planned to read aloud to each what they saw, but I felt this would end up getting a little too impersonal and repetitive, since there are definite backstory elements I'd rather include for a couple characters that I don't want to reveal outright this early on, plus I'd like to have these instigate a small amount of uncertainty between the characters that can only really come if they don't know each others' visions.

Today however was a sour session due to certain encounters being 'too easy' from the DM's perspective. Two major instances of this. Firstly, we were being chased by soldiers and were backed up against a river. Our Cleric cast Water Walk on party, which specifically states ""move across any liquid surface...as if it were harmless solid ground"". The DM asked us to roll Acrobatics to see how well we navigated the water, deciding on the spot that it's not harmless solid ground but raging solid water?? The Cleric that cast it to stop the danger (two soldiers had instantly died/been washed away by the river) has low Dex so this could've been bad, fortunately he rolled well so we made it. We were then confronted by 4 Orc Warchiefs who happened to approach in a close knit line. They all failed the save on my Hypnotic Pattern so we then started focusing. After that 1 round, our DM decided 30 seconds had gone and my spell only had half duration left? We had to end session there, but those Orcs could easily kill one of our party in a turn and that spell was a life saver. I haven't been a DM, but for me it just seems like poor planning/knowledge on his part (we don't tell him spells, abilities etc bc in the past the world has somehow mitigated all of them and it's very jarring/unimmersive).

DnD,Obese_Tostitos527,36,"What the frick is with stat rolling system? Most people prefer to roll stats in this game. But there are soooo many different systems people use for rolling stats. And maybe you disagree, but I don‚Äôt think most of these dice rolling systems are fair. Most prominent I think is the 4d6; drop lowest system, so forgive my straw-manning of it here. 4d6; drop lowest has a minimum and maximum that can make you literally the smartest/fastest/strongest/wisest/healthiest/savviest person on the continent, or inhumanly stupid/slow/weak/anemic/unwise/introverted. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense that those maximum outcomes are even a possibility for level 1 adventurers, or that anybody could have a 3 and be a normal member of society, let alone make it to adulthood. And the worst of all, the average roll for 4d6; drop lowest is 12. Most of the time when you roll this way, you only have one stat that is slightly below average. That‚Äôs not bad on its own, but you also have other stats that are way above average. Since when were negatives bad? The way I see it, average means there should be just as many stats below average as there are above average. The one system I see as fair is simply 4d4. Minimum is 4, still bad, but an improvement from 3. Maximum is 16. And best of all, the average is perfectly 10. This game is about telling stories. And as adamant as we are against the whole ‚ÄòMary Sue‚Äô trope, our dice rolling systems contribute to it.",1
DnD,DireWolfStar,12,"Mimic Armor Alright so, I first of all don't know if this is the right sub-reddit but oh well, second, I require assistance for a cool character idea I had. 

So, the idea is thus: my character is martial type (don't know if I should make him some weird paladin-type, barbarian \[I'm leaning to this one more\] or a fighter) but his armor is a large mimic, and if he doesn't a humans worth of  meat a day it'll eat him, causing him to instantly die as he's, well, wearing it as armor, and no, he can't take it off, it's stuck on him with a curse, and he's trying to find a way to get it off. ooh, I just realized this makes him immune to the weird metal rust monsters, as his armor isn't technically metal.

His fighting style: he mainly goes for punches, the mimic produces spikes/teeth from his knuckles, so as he punches stuff, they get ripped apart, and if he ""hugs"" them, a large mouth opens up in the lower abdomen, and starts eating whatevers there.

His quest: The mimic is stuck on him with a SUPER powerful curse, the closest he can get to taking it off is lifting the visor on his face. So he's trying to find this very specific magical scroll with what is pretty much the only thing that can get the armor off (the scroll was made by the same person who cursed, fully expecting my guy to be dead by now)

So, I mainly need help with stat blocks for the mimic, I was thinking he could feed it materials or sets of armor to either change the ""material"" of the mimic, making it stronger, or if he feeds it a set of armor, just the set, not with anything in it, then it'll just eat whats in the armor and burp the stuff back up, then it'll take on the characteristics of that set of armor, or it could just level up with him to get stronger. Alright, I think that's it (but you should expect edits, I might think of more to add, before I do, go off)",1

DnD,Odvaskar,5,"Full-Time Professional DM looking for players Hello there,

I am Odvaskar but you can call me Oscar. I have been playing/DMing Dungeons and Dragons games for over 4 years now, ever since I was introduced and fell in love with the game. I started being a Dungeon Master when my group lost our DM, and going through D&amp;D withdrawals pushed me to take up the mantle. I realized I had a talent for running adventures, so I decided to start run pay to play campaigns on a large community of D&amp;D enthusiasts on discord. I have 4 campaigns that have been running for a year and I'm excited to start many more!

Game style: My DMing style is best described as balanced. I encourage character interaction, development and interpersonal roleplay. I have ample experience running efficient, challenging and satisfying combat encounters as well (I don't pull punches or fudge rolls). I try my best to immerse my players into the world in any way I can; helping to develop character backstories that fit into the campaign, rehearsed NPC voices (some may be slightly unpolished!) and fitting background music accompaniment.

Communication: Discord

Payment: ¬£15.80 per session via Paypal

DnD,Sweet_Middle,4,"First PC died.. I'm a new DM running 5E LMOP via Roll20. Have a party of, to all intents and purposes, brand new players and we've been going for only a few weeks. They've come the circuitous route to tresendar manor so are going through as level 3. Last night the rogue, from max health of 13, was taken down by one crit of 26 from a bugbear. It was just one of those games where the dice are horrible, it was just miss after miss. Then....it happened.
I totally didnt see it coming, I roll the dice publicly so there was no fudging. With hindsight I could have done something but it's too late. They are dead.
I managed to improv a deity into their death and the party have met the wizard at old owl well who I am figuring would be able to cast resurrect so we've got some options. I'm also talking to the player so they can steer it whether they want to be resurrected or if they want to roll a new character but I've warned them that it's going to depend on the rest of the party and the dice exactly what's happened.

DnD,Systine,0,"Sidewalk DnD With the lockdown lingering in place in my area of the world parents are desperately trying to find things to keep the kids active. One thing I have noticed is there are lots of signs posted on street light poles that have activities for kids to do, a common one is a scavenger hunt where kids go from location to location and either have to find something or perform some kind of task.  These are scattered all over a large area so it is unlikely that kids to be gathered together to perform these tasks.   


So, I was thinking if there was a way to implement some kind of DnD themed one that would have the kids build simple characters and battle monsters or complete challenges. There was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/fzj4r5/help_us_make_a_chalkdrawn_dd_inspired_sidewalk/) I found from about a month ago that was a similar idea, but it didn‚Äôt get to many responses. Obviously, I can‚Äôt have anything that requires touching something that is then touched by others later, so I can‚Äôt have some kind of dice mechanic using a spinner or something ‚òπ.  


My rough idea was at the starting point have a very basic character sheet in you could tear off and use. At each stop they would be some tear-off tabs on the bottom of the sheet with the encounter (similar to the phone number on for sale signs) that could be glued to the character sheet or copied to it that would give the character new abilities. Basically, you would need to search out the poles that have the encounters around the neighbourhood (clues could be given on where the are) and complete each encounter. There would be no explicit order to complete the encounters in but some might be to difficult to win until you complete some others to build up your character.",1

DnD,Amber1717Amber,3,"Advice on what my caricature can know by default with story background. I am playing dnd for my first time. I have played a few sessions and am level 4. Last session we had an encounter with 3 ogres that did not go as the DM planed. So coming up over a hill we hear a loud cry that I recognize as vaguely draconic since I am a Dragonborn. And see what looks like a cart off in the distance about a half mile away. Right away a Druid in our party turns into a mouse and runs toward the cart. Looses track of time and the turns back into regular form right as she gets to the cart. 3 ogres kill her while it takes us a huge amount of turns to reach the battle. Due to to some really lucky rolls including shield throws at the ogres heads that stunned them. And a very risky acrobatic move where I used a party members shield raised above there head as a springboard to jump and plunge a spear sticking out of an ogres arm further in to pin his arm to his side. We killed all three with almost everyone down to less than 5 health. We freed a young silver dragon trapped under a magical tarp and chains. By picking a huge magical lock that we where not supposed to be able to pick when I rolled a 19 +7 slight of hand. After making friends with the dragon he left to go to find a Mate in some Moutan Range 4 days away(for the dragon). 

Out of game I read up on silver dragons and found that they like to help people when asked and like to learn from people and sometimes can take human form. 

As a Dragonborn pirate can I just know this or would I have to learn it in game. I want to build some sort of relationship with this dragon using the sending spell once I learn it and invite it to come join the party in human form for a while leading up to a large battle we have been building up to by playing on that knowledge.

# D

&amp;#x200B;

**Dao**

*Etymology*: Uncertain

*First Appearance*: First appeared in the tournament version of the *S4 - The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth* (1976), later in Monster Manual II (1983)

Origin: Unknown, appears to have been invented to give a fourth element to the genies (with djinn/efreeti/marid taken from Middle Eastern mythology)

&amp;#x200B;

**Darkmantle**

*Etymology****:*** Portmanteau of *dark* \+ *mantle* (‚Äúa robe or cloak‚Äù), from Old English *mentel* (‚Äúsleeveless cloak‚Äù), from Latin *mantƒìllum* (‚Äúcovering/cloak‚Äù)

*First Appearance*: 3rd Edition Monster Manual (2000).

*Origin*: Uncertain, appearance appears to be based on the real-world vampire squid. It is possible it is an updated version of the Lurker creature that appeared in the 1st Edition Monster Manual (1977), which was a manta-ray-like creature that would hide on the ceiling and drop down and envelope anyone who walked under it. The Lurker‚Äôs underside looked like stone so it would camouflage as a ceiling, while the darkmantle disguises itself as a stalactite. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Death Knight**

*First Appearance**:* Fiend Folio (1981)

*Origin*: Uncertain. In the original Fiend Folio entry, it is specified that only 12 of these lich-like creatures exist (likely created by the Demogorgon from fallen paladins). This is almost certainly a reference to the 12 Peers of Charlamagne, as a death knight is the polar opposite of a Paladin. The 12 peers, also called paladins, were the 12 knights that led the armies of Charlemagne (compare to the Knights of the Round Table in England). These were holy christian warriors that appear in various stories, most famously *The Song of Roland* (11th Century). Of note is many of the paladin‚Äôs carried named-swords that contained holy relics, which is part of the origin of the Holy Avenger (Durendal, Almace, Joyeuse, Halteclere, etc).

&gt;*‚ÄúInstead it flies rebounding to the sky.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*When the count sees he cannot shatter it,*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In soft tones to himself he makes lament*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Ah, Durendal, holy and fair you are!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Relics in plenty fill your gilded hilt*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Saint Peter's tooth, some of Saint Basil's blood,*

**Dakon**

*Etymology**:* Unknown

*First Appearance**:* Fiend Folio (1981)

*Origin*: Uncertain; a lawful neutral intelligent ape is a common occurrence in pulp fiction and film, but a direct connection to anything specific is unclear.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dark Creeper (Darkling)**

*First Appearance**:* Fiend Folio (1981)

*Origin*: Uncertain

&amp;#x200B;

**Demilich**

*Etymology**: demi* \+ *lich*.  Demi, from Latin *demidius* (‚Äúhalf‚Äù).

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

*Origin*: Taken from Fritz Leiber‚Äôs *Thieves‚Äô House* (1943), a Fafhrd and Gray Mouser story

&amp;#x200B;

**Demodand**

*Etymology*: The name is a modification of *deodand,* from English *deodand* (‚Äúsomething forfeited because it caused the death of a person‚Äù), from Latin *deodandum* (‚Äúto be given to God‚Äù), from *deo* (‚Äúgod‚Äù) + *dandum* (‚Äúto be given‚Äù)

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

*Origin*: Taken from deodand, evil creatures in Jack Vance‚Äôs Dying Earth series. In the novels, deodands are humanoids that look handsome, but with ‚Äúdead black lusterless skin and long slit eyes‚Äù. In D&amp;D, there are three types of demodands (also known as Gehreleths); these include the Ferastu (Terry), Kulbar (Slime), and Shator (Shaggy). I can find no sources for these particular variants or names.

&amp;#x200B;

**Derro**

Etymology: From German *dwerrow* (‚Äúdwarf‚Äù)

*First Appearance*: First appeared in the tournament version of the S4 - The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (1976), later in Monster Manual II (1983)

Origin: Possibly a combination of Norse dwarf and black elves. In Skandiavian mythology, there is not a clear distinction between dwarves, svart√°lfr (Black Elves), and d√∂kk√°lfar (Dark Elves). In the stories of Richard Shaver, the dero were a subterranean degenerate race of men, which may have been the source of the D&amp;D creature.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deva**

*Etymology*: Sanskrit *deva* (‚Äúdeity‚Äù). From Proto-Indo-European *deiwos* (‚Äúcelestial/shining‚Äù), from *diw* (‚Äúto shine‚Äù). In Europe, several god‚Äôs names are derived from the same root, including Zeus, Deus, Jupiter, and Tyr, as well as the words divine, deity, and Tuesday (Tyr‚Äôs Day).

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

*Origin*: In Indian mythology, Deva are benevolent supernatural beings with a strong connection to nature. Also called Sura, they are often at war with the chaotic Asura. Described as ""eternal orbs of light"". D&amp;D appearance is closer to the Judeo-Christian angel.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva\_(Hinduism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism))

&amp;#x200B;

**Deva, Astral**

*Etymology*: Late Latin *astralis*, from Latin *astrum* (‚Äúa star‚Äù), from Ancient Greek *astron* (‚Äústar‚Äù)

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

&amp;#x200B;

**Deva, Monadic**

*Etymology*: From English *monad* (‚Äúsomething ultimate and indivisible‚Äù), From Ancient Greek *monadikos* (‚Äúsingle‚Äù), from *monas* (‚Äúa unit‚Äù)

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

*Origin*: Possibly from the Greek philosophical concept of the Monad, a term for divinity (the first or totality of all beings).

&amp;#x200B;

**Deva, Movanic**

*Etymology*: The term Movanic is used by Lewis Spence in *An Encyclopedia of Occultism* (1920), as another word for *atmic*, or *spiritual*. Atman is the Hindo concept of the inner self or soul. As the name Deva was also taken from Hindu vedic works, this connection would be logical, but it is unconfirmed.

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

&amp;#x200B;

*First Appearance**:*  First appeared in the fantasy supplement for Chainmail (1971) which included Red Dragons (based on Smaug), along with a brief summary of Blue/White/Black/Green dragons, as well Purple Dragons (see Purple Worm). The Gold Dragon first appeared in D&amp;D in the original D&amp;D set (1974) as the only lawful dragon (all others were chaotic). The original D&amp;D Greyhawk supplement (1976), added what is now the standard list of 5 good metalic (brass/copper/bronze/silver/gold) and 5 evil chromatic dragons, along with the Platinum (King of Lawful) and Chromatic (Queen of Chaotic) dragons.

*Origin*: Dragons appear in various forms in multiple cultural mythologies. The D&amp;D dragon is based mostly on the European model, with 4 legs and wings. Originally, gold dragons were designed based on asian dragons, being long and wingless, however in 3rd edition their design was changed to match the other winged dragons. The name is often applied to reptilian monsters of other world myths, such as the Chinese *long* or the Mesoamerican *couatl*. Gygax originally created 5 evil colored dragons, matching their breath weapon to their color, and then added a good Gold dragon, based on the Chinese dragon. Later, to flesh out the list, he added 4 more metal-dragons with power in order of the metal value (with Platinum at the peak as Bahamut).

The most I can get is just vague information about how they operate above ground and some allusion to infiltrating minor political offices, but that's not really enough info for what I'm trying to accomplish.

Any help would be much appreciated.",1

My current idea is to start the campaign with the PCs on a wagon as one of the PCs take the lead, on their way to the destination they'll encounter a crashed carriage, the coachman dead with a fatal injury from the impact and the horse on a deepslumber, inside the carriage lays the MacGuffin.

After this encounter they'd continue down the road, and start to strangely feel sleepy again, and wake up in a dungeon cell with their equipment on the end of the jail room. Easily scaping out of the jails and now with their equipment, they find themselves on a castle, many rooms to explore with a few enemies of weak wisps, an animated statue and animated books, hints on to what the castle is for and who is the person who kidnaped them are and why and the MacGuffin in one room. If they press ""the big red button"" the magic that holds the castle's bricks together will start to fade, and they'll have a ""countdown"" to leave the castle before it crumbles to the ground with them (at least make them feel like that, don't want a TPK on session 1), leaving the castle and seeing that it invisible until it falls to ruins, ending near where they were but now with common magic items, gold, the MacGuffin, a mystery and a sense of danger.",1

Hey everyone! Here is a little analysis of all the rolls that my group did in Roll20 since we started our campaign a couple of years ago.

The thing that stood out to me after all the data analysis was the fact that the d20 rolls all seemed to come out to around average once they were calculated. 

It was also nice to see certain quirks when it came to the dice rolling. Like our sorcerer, who currently has rolled more d6s then she has d20s (totally because of fireball).  And that everyone had a different variance when it came to critical rolls. 

All the players, except for me (the fighter) had rolled a nat 20 within their second roll, that did not come until my 41st roll. It was a running joke in our campaign that I (The Fighter) was a connoisseur of natural 1‚Äôs and it turns out that it is indeed the truth (with the exception of our GM who seems to roll them a lot as well).

Also, we do not have a player that has triple classed, he has just played 3 different characters to see what he likes!",1

DnD,En_Mushroom,4,"What kind of diplomacy would be realistically achieavable with the Githyanki?  I'm  a DM for a 5e campaign set in the Forgotten Realms and my party has  recently been trapped in the Astral Plane due to the good old bag of  holding into portable hole trick (done by one of the PCs).

The  party is level 5 so they have no access to extraplanar travel spells  yet. Through a series of fortunate and unfortunate events they have  ended up at Tu'narath after 22 days in the Astral Plane and last session  ended with them approaching the city. No contact with the Githyanki has  been made yet.

I have done some  research and it seems that generally speaking the Githyanki are  extremely xenophobic, have no tendency to help astral travellers and are  normally the kind of race you'd want to avoid, but as of now they are  the only chance for the party to escape the Astral Plane without wasting  weeks or months wandering around aimlessly (the main story line on the  Material Plane is rather time sensitive).

I like to leave my players plenty of options to tackle the challenges ahead and so far I've been planning for these three.

1. Stealth  1: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes mentions that prisoners taken by the  Githyanki are often just left to fend for themselves in one of the more  inhospitable areas of Tu'narath. The party could sneak into the city and  join forces with a group of these prisoners who has access to  extraplanar travel but need additional aid to do it (spellbook stolen by  the Githyanki or something).
2. Stealth  2: The party could attempt to steal one of the Githyanki astral vessels  and find a way to locate the closest color pool to the Material Plane.  This could be also done with the aid of the prisoners.
3. Diplomacy:  This is the option that I'm struggling the most to prepare for. I'm  pondering about what sort of deal the Githyanki would offer in exchange  to passage to the Material Plane. Clearing an Illithid lair would be a  fair deal, but the Illithid are extinct on the Astral Plane, and if the  party were to be sent to clear a lair on the Material Plane then nothing  would stop them from simply leaving without holding their part of the  deal. Trading is an abysmally slim chance as the party doesn't have any  item that the Githyanki would find particularly interesting.

So here comes the big question: What would the Githyanki realistically demand in exchange for help?",1
DnD,Horus3,277,"Orcs ain't black people TL;DR: Comparing fantasy races to real world ethnicities can be problematic at best.

Hey fellow nerds. Now that you are here let me put you at ease. This is not a rage filled rant, just a case being made for slight course correction in the new ""woke gamer"" space we find ourselves in.

I am an experienced DM (and POC) thats been playing for over 15 years, and in my talks with folks about DnD I have noticed an interesting pattern. 

Some folks are conflating orcs with black people.

A buddy of mine stated (with nothing but good will) that the description of half orcs in the 5e PHB was problematic.The point he was trying to make is that orc culture is rife with descriptions of savages that can't overcome their primal nature. Half orcs, with their human blood, are normally leaders of orc tribes because they are smart and tactical, a step above their beastly cohorts. He claimed they may as well have replaced the word 'orc' with 'black' and 'human' with 'white'. There is a tradition in this country (Merica!) of using derogatory language when describing black people. Savages, beasts, sub humans. Many white supremacists would argue that mulatto children were smarter than other blacks because of their 'white blood'.  Despite the similarities in these descriptions I would like to make something clear.

Black people aren't orcs. Black people are humans. 

In these modern times when representation and the breaking of stereotypes is so important I am all for challenging the traditional role of orcs. Make them civilized delitants. Make them super scientists. Change how they are represented in your game. But let's not be confused by our attempts to change our perceptions of a fantasy race of pig nosed raiders by claiming that they are a stand in for a particular ethnicity.

If you see the descriptions orcs and think ""hey, they are talking about black people!"" then you have assigned all of the traits listed in the orc entry in the MM to African Americans. Which isn't good, in my opinion. 

Black people aren't orcs. Black people are humans.

I had another encounter with a person who had never played DnD before and I was explaining the different fantasy races to them. I myself am biracial (half white/half black) and when I ran through the standard races they said, ""oh, so you'd be like a half orc."" This person did not mean any ill intent, but they were very much mistaken. Whether you are a woke culture warrior challenging the way society looks at gender and race or a lifelong gamer trying to shift paradigms in your play, try to remember:

Black people aren't orcs. Black people are humans.

I love orcs. I think they are cool. Great warriors with a rich fiction. I was introduced to them in version 3.5 and I was blown away by their raw power and their pious culture. A towering pile of muscles and tusks spawned by an evil god to swarm across the world and kill and eat everything in their path. Great story fodder. And an objectivity offensive list of traits to try to ascribe to the black community. Because, and this is the last time I swear:

Black people aren't orcs. Black people are humans. 

Play the game your way. Do whatever is fun for you and your group. Explore different roles that fantasy races can play. The sky is the limit. But when you read the text for a FANTASY race in a FANTASY game and start comparing them to an ethnicity in the real world, take a moment. Think about what connections you are making and how many of them are driven by stereotypes and stunted understandings of other cultures. Let's not make each other into caricatures. 

Thank you!",1
DnD,deadghost316,7,"Why aren't Yaun-ti or Kenku good picks for a Rogue? They both get a boost for the DEX stats, not to mention they both fit the aesthetic of the edgy Rogue, which is something I love.

But anyways, Kenku has racial abilities that fit the manipulative and thievery nature of the Rogue. And Yauni-tis get Magic Resistance and a few spells that fit the Deceptive nature of the Rogue. The Rogue becomes a dodgy prick really fast, forcing the DM to throw more powerful spells in oppose to PHYS attacks. So, isn't the Magic Resistance a good trait?

That's what I thought at least until I checked what everyone else thought about it. And it turns out, they're bad picks for the class. Not that a lot of players pick better races so they're not used often, but that they're at the bottom of the barrel. So I figured I should ask around as to why

Be fearless

Never turn away from a fight.

The second one is where the question comes in. This is a god of ""Honorable Combat"", so at what point is a fight no longer a fight, and just suicide. My character and the party has fled a village that was being pillaged by about 3 tribes worth of orcs, (a small army), and at one point my character was faced with either fighting 20 orcs, and a nightmare horse at level 3, or GTFO. He'll chose the latter. So would these break those tenants?

DnD,goldtooththekobold,17,"So here's a question for all of you the Ponder. So I got a question. It's about paladins and clerics. This is me not going to complain how overpowered they are or they have a bunch of stupid abilities. But this is me going to talk about their alignments and the gods they follow. 

Now I know a lot of people agree that alignments are like guidelines you don't really need to follow it somewhat. But here's the thing for paladins and clerics for them to keep their abilities they have to follow the wishes of their God and most Paladin and cleric gods are usually in the neutral or good category. 

So if most of them were in the good and neutral category that means half the stuff that they kill should instantly make them lose their abilities especially when it comes to children. I don't care if the kids had spun around 20 times and has demonic eyes it is still a child means you would lose your abilities if you killed it. So why hasn't no evil villain out there made an army of children and force the paladins and clerics that actually have to fight them.

You would think some big evil bad guy would do that by now. I mean I did have this conversation a while back about to make the ultimate Evil Lord an ultimate Evil Lord would use children in his army because that's an extra body he can use and it will stop a certain faction of people that can easily stop him. 

But anyway I would like your opinions on this. What do you think should happen when a cleric or Paladin just goes around killing everything on site and doesn't explain why they had to go and do that anak specially when it comes to them killing a kid.",1

They seemed shocked, and some players were kinda bitter towards the one that caused the havoc, causing this player to feel super bad and also making their character sulk badly.

So here's the situation. Something, very unlikely happened. I'm running a campaign for a few friends while we're quarantined. 

We're playing online, just so people know we are still self isolating! 

However, yesterday we were starting to build their characters, and as a way to determine ability scores, I allowed them to either pick the standard array, or roll the dices (4d6 and lose the lowest one). 

And something I have never seen before happened. A player rolled six 18's... He rolled 3 dices with 6 and usually one that wasn't a six, but in his last roll he actually rolled 4 sixes.


Now, this is a campaign they'll start at level one. Thus, I do think this character would be a bit too powerful. I mean, it borders on the demigod level.


They will be playing a dwarf cleric (Forge Domain), and I'm not too sure about how to deal with it. Part of me want to ask him to reroll. But he got so excited at those scores that I feel bad to ask such a thing.


None of the other characters rolled so well. Comparatively while he had a total off 108bl stats points. The rest of the party are around 80.


I want to ask if anyone had to deal with it, and how did you deal with it.

Inspired by the monastery and the lives of the monks the criminal took a new turn during his years of imprisonment. He turned into a monk. Now years later he gets released as a new man. Or is he?

I play as a forest gnome cleric that has found his call to protect the weak after his home was destroyed. 

I dont harm those that are weak and/or defensless and try to find good wherever I can. Recently my Party has taken a goblin captive and despite innitial worries of our tiefling rougue who has been a slave in her past I managed and because of that dislikes chains to convince the Party to chain up the Goblin and take him with us. 

I am trying to show the Goblin that the usual goblin ways are bad and that he can live a happy live under the protection of the church of helm if he chooses to Join the side of protection and justice. 

I fear that I might fail. The Goblin named durk has shown a want to create his own goblin group that he wants to lead. 

If I fail to convert him to good i might not kill him since he hasnt been violent but I would try to imprison him. But that might be for a goblin to cruel and he might just be misstreatred and tortured. If I imprison him only to followers of helm whom I trust.

DnD,Haldenwanger,12,"What would an archmage do, if adventurers brought her 15 phylacteries, and what would the Liches do? If you play a character named enigma, lupus or selmos, stop reading here.

So my players managed to imprison an archlich, took the phylacteries of his underlings and brought them to an archmage.

If you were that archmage, what would you do?

And since the PCs managed to destroy some of the phylacteries, I assume that the liches know, that someting happend to their stuff.

Now what would they do? 


My idea was that the archmage contacts other archmages and creates a protectiv barrier against divination and teleportation. Then they would search for a way to destroy the phylacteries.

The liches will go to that plane and find the place destroyed and their stuff missing. They start scrying, head out with a small army and try to get the stuff back. If the scrying fails, they kill one lich and let him respawn near the phylacterys. He than calls out to the others and wreck the place.

DnD,zmarotrix,9,"As a new DM I've been told new players make uninteresting characters, but I'm having a very different experience. So I've been getting into being a DM recently and I wanted to get some more of my friends into D&amp;D. The other week we ended up having our sessions 0 and I was ready to help players build their characters. My plan was to help them mechanically put together their character during session 0 and give them a week to fully flesh out the backstory and personality of their characters. My instructions were;

*""This is primarily a story about heros or more accurately, people wanting to do good things. Without the motivation to do good in the world, the story will slow to a crawl and more often than not the plot will go cold. When making your character - even if they are evil - make sure they have a reason to want to do good in the world.""*

Everyone was new and none of us are writers so I was not expecting too much but by the end of session 0 I was so excited to start the game. Here are 2 examples of characters that were made;

**Glem Dimbletimber** True Neutral 

A Gnome Bard and an estranged aristocrat who has been shunned from his family name because of his reputation for arrogance and self-indulgence. So now he's on a quest to better his reputation with the lands in order to earn back his family's inheritance. He also only acknowledges people who refer to him as his full name AND has a thing for Half-Orc ""Thicc"" girls.

**Marlin Brought** Lawful Evil-ish

A Half-Golem (originally human) Warlock who's an asshole gambler snake oil salesman who worshiped his lady patron Tymora. Because of his luck and success in the world, his hubris lead him to try and swindle Mammon himself who ended up cursing him to be half made of gold in order to make a mockery of his own greed. He was told the only way this curse would be lifted if he could prove to the world that that he's not as much as a selfish greedy dick as he's made out to be. Issue being, he simply is and Mammon knows this. Mammon made the conditions of the curse vague and basically impossible for Marlin so the curse will likely never be lifted. 

**John Johnson II (John's Son) of Johnston** Chaotic Good

A Human Wizard who has been flung back in time with only a vague memory of who he is or what the future holds. His transdimensional travels have left his mind in chaos and thus he has a warped perception of what is real. His desire to get back to his proper time has led him down the path of Wizardry in order to harness the powers of time itself. His character is also acutely aware that every action he takes now will effect the future dramatically and thus, does his best to try and make the world a better place. He also insists that his full title is ""John Johnson II (John's Son) of Johnston"" because these are the only things he can remember about who he was before and he wants to make sure he never forgets them. 


I'm really excited about this group and I've already planning out a plot point based solely on the fact that that there is no town in this world named ""Johnston"" and thus John will inevitability end up founding the very town in which he was born.",1
DnD,FrostDragon57,27,"My DM set me up... Playing a rogue arcane trickster.

Me and my party were going through an abandoned mine and found a lair of a sorcerer.

Who without much thought, unleashed several spells at us before we could react.

Long story boring, we defeated the sorcerer and raided his lair.
I rolled especially high and found a scroll hidden under a board in the floor.
The scroll contained only a list of ingredients and how to make a potion. No descriptipn of the potion was to be found. No name... nothing.

I handed it to our mage, who after a good long hard look, couldn't figure out what it was. So he handed it back to me.

When we got back to town, curiousity got the better of me so I decided to buy all the ingredients and make the potion. I completed it successfully, but I didn't drink it.

I didn't know what it did. So I went to an alchemist we knew. She wasn't able to identify it either, so she literally drank it in front of me.

A few seconds later, she was clinging to me and was beet red, warm to the touch and well... how do I put this?... Very handsy.

Turns out that the potion I made was a permanent love potion.

And in this world, love potions are extremely illegal.

So... I have a lot of explaining to do if I'm caught. And I also have to deal with... her...

Meanwhile, out of game. My DM just smiled",1

DnD,jp_read2,8,"PC mutilates face of another PC, ideas for what to do next? I DM a Campaign for 4 PCs, we are currently running Hoard of the Dragon Queen, but I am putting plenty of my own twists and home-brew bits in.  

This campaign I allow PC on PC combat should it so be desired (I know this is often frowned upon, but we are all close mates so it weirdly works).

Anyway, Our monk a female player playing a half-elf woman got into a fight with another PC, a half-ling fighter after they disagreed about putting an NPC out of his misery after an axe wound (the NPC was a child). She grabbed a carrot and before her intentions became clear (thank goodness) the halfing fatally wounded her and left her with a gash across her face . She obvs will recover but I intend to give her a large scar. 

Has anyone got any good ideas for how I can balance what has happened? I am thinking giving her more intimation points, perhaps she is healed by a fairy and gains a new power? I want to do this because she likes to seduce people in game and now that is going to be hindered.

Any ideas of what to do with her PC would be awesome. Thanks x

We are at the start of HotDQ where they are attempting to get through greenest to the keep, they failed. Two got captured and are being led away, on is laying dead in an abandoned house (see above) while the other is alone having just left the girl dying. One of the two captured choose the scholar background/hook which means he is a dragon intellectual and has been recognised by someone in the dragon cult (after a good persuasion roll) so is being treated well as he and his companion are being led away all be it under armed guard. 

Need to somehow pull this all together, because the players love it and will work together when they are all back together.",1

DnD,LTwr3nch,2,"Help with pirate-themed caimpaing. I know this is clich√©, but I was dming a pirate caimpaing some while back. It was supposed to just be a single session, but the players liked it so I just continued doing sessions without really doing my homework on this kind of thing. Welp, things didn't go as planned and I put the campaing on hold because It was way too similar to a normal D&amp;D game, the only difference being that instead of fighting goblins on forests, the players were fighting sailors on beaches. I couldn't even come up with a naval battle system, for fucks sake.   
So, I'm going to give this one more shot. Luckly the players didn't get attached to their characters, and still want the campaing to continue. So this time I'm actually going to write a story for it, instead of making it on the fly and trying to fill in the blanks as we go. But, there's still the gameplay problem.   
I don't really know if D&amp;D5e's naval combat is good enough to have a whole campaing centered on it. So, I need a system for naval combat that's actually good/fun, and not overly complicated (the players aren't really boat intusiasts, most of them just want the good ol' drinking and looting stuff. Also, doesn't need to be an official system, just a good one). I would like information on pirate-themed classes as well (Again, doesn't have to be official). Enemies aren't a must but it would help in some aspects. If anyone know something that fits all of this, please share with me, I'd certainly appreciate it.

DnD,WeissCrowley,8,"Lore advice! I wrote myself into a corner and I need help!!
That being said, here's what's happening. On the road between adventurers I sometimes roll a d4 for the party for random encounters, if things appear stale between RP and actual missions. 

1- Weird Animal (one appears in the environment on the road. It's the random nothing burger roll. Just a thing in the environment)

2- Trouble With Locals (chance to help locals being attacked by bandits/ monsters or settle disputes. Opportunity for items/ potion bartering, info on the world around.)

3- Dirtbag Necromancer (Malik Nerduwell, the dirtbag necromancer appears and summons a strange undead to fight the party. Then disappears laughing like a jerk. This is the bad roll.)

4- Sitar Man (Salim Yahtif, the hippie lore bard can be heard playing his sitar. Wherever it's played, normally hostle monsters are at rest around him, are enchanted by the music and instead are pretty chill. Chance for short rest and snacks if needed.)

Here I'm focusing on the Sitar Man, which has me concerned. The party has been playing for a while. They're at level 8 now. So far he's appeared;

Sewers with giant rats
Forest swamp with giant toads
Mountain cliffside with a pair of griffins
Underground with earth elementals
On a beach with crabfolk and octopus folk (two races in perpetual war)

When he's done playing, any creatures near him walk away in a pleasant dazed state. Then He always takes a puff of his hookah and vanishes with the smoke. (Hookah of teleportation, an item of my own design) Sometimes the party tries to talk to him, but none of them roll high enough to convince him to stay. (He's a free spirit, man. That and I made the DC a natural 20. I'm sly like that.) 

Well, of all people the freaking BARBARIAN rolled a natural 20 to convince him to stay. (Freaking lucky halflings) That and his charisma is 10. No minuses at all, and his lowest stat. It's my fault as DM for not giving Sitar Man a fleshed out backstory other than random short rest stop and it came back to bite me. They asked him questions. Who he was, why he kept appearing in these random places. What's the deal with his music. 

Luckily this was getting to the end of the session. So I left them with Sitar Man saying, 'I'm just a free spirit from far away, man. Music and good vibes are my trade. I give them freely wherever I go. Salim Yahtiff is my name among those who speak the tongues of mortals. Who and what are you, man?'

THATS ALL I COULD COME UP WITH. It was the heat of the moment, you know how it is! Does anyone have any help they can give me fleshing this dude out before next session? The party is on a quest to find a sea hag to collect the soul gem of a count that's helped them out in the past many times, hence why they're on the beach where she was last seen. Yet now they have his attention, they wanna go all in on the Sitar Man! Help!",1

&amp;#x200B;

01 Well I've heard of survival of the fittest, but not the dumbest! 

02 I'm not saying you have big teeth, but do druids make a pilgrimage to you on summer solstice!

03 I guessing you're unable to have children, because when your partner is turned on, the sight of you turns them off! 

04 Well if you're an example of a typical hireling, just how s\*\*\* is the final boss! 

05 I think I've just found the answer to the missing link... to flem! 

06 They say that there's a good book inside everyone, but I think with your intelligence, yours is more of a watermark! 

07 What are you going to do for a face when the monkey wants it's arse back! 

08 So, is this really the face of terror? A walking charity shop bargain bin! 

09 I'm guessing some blind person found out how much that dog in the window was and decided you were worth the asking price! 

10 While Rapunzel is famous for letting her hair down, I'm guessing you're famous for letting your family down!

11 I'm not sure which stinks more, your appearance or your personality, but I'd compare both to hemorrhoids wrapped in bacon! 

12 Well, I always wanted to know what a big toe would look like if it was a person! 

13 Wow. Its not often I get to meet someone as cultivated as you. No wait, I'm thinking of goats cheese!

14 I've seen bad dress sense before, but you're like flotsam held together by optimisim! 

15 I don't think you need a nose job, more of a nose career! 

16 I was going to roast you, but cows are sacred where I come from! 

17 Your existence is like the terms of service agreement... We don't care about it but sometimes when something goes wrong, we get reminded it exists! 

18 You appear to be something that slipped through a badly thought out unearthed arcana! 

19 I know the stereotype of ogres being stupid is well known, but you really live up to it! 

20 By the gods, I think you should give that Owlbear it's eyebrows back! 

21 Just how do you get through doors with a face that wide? 

22 I'm glad you decided to go with a comb over, you could use that forehead as a spell focus for a dancing light cantrip! 

23 Your personality is like the elemental plane of air. Blue, depressing, and often empty! 

24 I think the only way to improve your intelligence is for you to be hit by a falling horse cart! 

25 I'd write a play about you, but I'm not sure I could find a hag ugly enough to play your part! 

26 I'm guessing you're the result of a drunken night between your parents and a centaur! 

27 No matter how many Disguise Self spells you receive, it will never fool that spirit in the magic mirror! 

28 Your head looks like someone drew a face on a plum and then lost it for a month! 

29 You have a body that looks like it was made from piles that the gods twisted in to a balloon animal! 

30 With your skill level, I doubt you could cope with an angry beaver! 

31 While I hate to point out your wandering eye, I'm guessing you saw what I did there.... and what the fighter did over there as well! 

32 I wish the city guard were here to take you away, because if I have to stare at you for much longer, I'm going to have to look at a pig's arse just to forget the image of your face! 

33 You're about as effective as a cat flap in a manticore's lair! 

34 Looking at you, I'm guessing your mother was so large, she was rogered by an ogre mage's omnibus! 

35 I'd like to say something positive about you, but there's so many negatives, I'm guessing that how the negative plane of energy was created! 

36 You look like that famous investigator Dick Tracy, but, without the Tracy! 

37 I believe you have the intellectual capacity of an empty potion bottle! 

38 I'm guessing your nose is so far up your own arse, you can smell what you had for breakfast! 

39 You couldn't hit water if you fell out of a boat! 

40 How are you still standing when it looks like your face has fallen through the floor! 

41 Well it's true, you are what you eat, because you're an ass! 

42 One day I will find myself in a place where I will think of you in the past, and use wish spell to make sure I don't meet another f\*\*ktard like you! 

43 You are a beautiful, smart, talented, important, special, and loved individual. Said no one ever! 

44 Sorry, just like your girlfriend, I've lost interest in you, quicker than a paid whore! 

45 I'm sure you were expecting to be the one to make a difference in this fight, but all you've done is changed the smell in the room! 

46 Roses are red. Violets are blue... Sorry I can't think of anything that rhymes with stunted pigman! 

47 It looks like you firmly believe that one size does indeed fit all, but have missed the part that it shouldn't! 

48 I'm not sure you're man enough to be in this line of work, because you sound like a cross between a squeaky door hinge and a chicken laying an egg! 

49 Do you need an apothecary? They can't fix stupid, but they could make you pretty enough that it'll distract people when you speak! 

50 I can tell talking to you will be like speaking to an irrate brick, but you're not intelligent enough to be a wall! 

51 I was tortured by a coven of hags, and listening to you feels pretty much the same! 

52 I'm not sure if I've suddenly become asthmatic or if it's you, but your aromatic pestilence just takes my breath away! 

53 Now I know five obese people, and you're three of them! 

54 How about you close your eyes and imagine yourself being a more likeable person, and then open them and weep! 

55 Just don't speak anymore because you sound like the humanoid equivalent to a bowl of conjured gruel! 

56 You may be an unworthy adversary but I do genuinely respect the way you wear your armpit hair upon your forehead! 

57 Imagine a tiny unborn child, dreaming of growing up and becoming something magnificent, only to have to look in the mirror this morning and see you! 

58 The only way you're walking away from this fight is if the grim reaper is a woman, because she will never come for you! 

59 The plague could be cured tomorrow and your nose would still be the biggest thing this week! 

60 I think I'm going to go to a mage school, study chronomancy, poor my heart and soul into the arcane arts, dedicate myself with blood, sweat and hopefully with luck, learn how to time travel. 

Then I can come back to several minutes previous to now and shoot myself with my own crossbow so I can avoid meeting such a tedious person such as you! 

61 Looking at you is like touching wet cat sick! 

62 You couldn't get laid in a monkey whorehouse with a fist full of bananas! 

63 Hopefully you're not a bard because the only thing you should host is a parasite! 

64 You call that an attack, you are more useless than the letter K in knife! 

65 It must be hard to determine who your father was seeing as it looks like the entire tavern jizzed into a glass and let it ferment for 9 months! 

66 It would take a team of 1000 gnomes, working for nearly 100 years to design a clockwork vehicle to plumb the crushing depths of my disappointment in meeting you at this moment! 

67 It's hard to be critical about someone when it obvious that you need to use a message cantrip to say hi to your feet! 

68 Well Humpty, while I can't say I'm the best looking, you appear to be a half eaten, over boiled egg! 

69 You're so basic, if I spilled water on you, you'd dissolve in to foam like a green wicked witch! 

70 You're two letters short of an asset! 

71 I would say that I think you're in over your head, but I have seen smaller beholders! 

72 You look like what morning breath smells like! 

73 You're like a monkey dancing for peanuts. Just sadder!

74 I just wanna know how many mirror images it would take before you give up and realise your face isn't going to look any less vacant from any angle! 

75 While it is clear that you think of nothing but gaining power, I have a dream, that one day you'll take a shower! 

76 So you're wasting our time, venting your anger on us, just because you can't get laid! 

77 You remind me of a sea hag in a bikini, because your appearance disgusts me! 

78 The only culture you possess is bacteria! 

79 Well look on the brightside. In a round or two, you'll be dead on the outside as well! 

80 Strange. I feel seeing your bloody corpse in the next few minutes is going to remind me of a firbolgs gonorrhea! 

81 Was your class invented before skills were needed? 

82 Wow. You look like regret made in flesh! 

83 I get the feeling that your relying on us losing this fight is like you relying on your father coming home from his trip to the corner store! 

84 So... i'm guessing you spend your downtime as an ogre fleshlight! 

85 Well... Whilst it's best not to believe every fairytale, I'm guessing between you and your brother, you're the grim one with that unibrow! 

86 I didn't know it was bring your chin to work day! 

87 How does it feel knowing I'm the child your mother wanted instead of the one she has! 

88 I was going to come up with a sick burn to insult you with, but it looks likes your face already has had one! 

89 Your fighting skill is like a vampires reflection, it doesn't exist! 

90 Well I'm glad that you've finally grown into your ears, now we just have to work on the rest of you! 

91 Please don't speak anymore, some people should learn not to open their mouth, and quite frankly, I'm surprised you allow your face out in public! 

92 You look like the mightiest of champions, apart from visually! 

93 I was going to give you a nugget of advice, but your fat ass will probably think it tastes like chicken and try and eat it! 

94 Hey, your grandma called. She wants her hair back! 

95 If I wanted to kill myself, I'd jump from your ego all the way down to your IQ!

96 So, which deity wasted a perfectly good asshole by putting teeth in your mouth! 

97 If you had half a brain, your ass would be lopsided! 

98 You'd make a great burglar, because your ass would rub out your footprints! 

99 I'm guessing from the smell, you like to bathe in your own ignorance!

Okay, this is a problem I've had when playing my druid so I'm really needing some tips on how to play a spell caster XD Context in case you haven't seen my other posts, really new player despite playing since july last year and prior to bringing Druid in and having her join the party, I've mainly only played my monk so at most I've had to deal with Ki points when kicking butt, and I'm pretty sure how I've been playing my druid is a little off from how I should battle and spell wise, plus I didn't do her spells as I wasn't sure how(dm never explained how to build a spell caster and I only have a vague idea outside of story stuff how to make sheets) and so my dm did them for me(and promptly regrets that cause of my Druid's favorite spell Call Lightning XD).

Like, how do I keep track of spell slots? Is there anything I should keep in mind when it's her turn to attack and she decides to use her magic instead of her katanas? Anything on spell casters that I might not know due to starting with a monk would be much appreciated, as I am planning on at some point multiclassing Monk as an Artificer if not a Bard(not sure if I can trio multiclass in 5e like I can in Neverwinter Nights) and a lot of my other characters I've not played yet are spell casters so I need all the help I can get XD",1

So, very very new to the whole dnd scene. Playing it with a friend, who suggested I make a life backstory for the character so they can incorporate it into the plot to some degree. But I‚Äôm trash at creativity and was wondering if people had opinions. 

Basically what I‚Äôve got is an Acolyte, Scourge Aasimar Blood Hunter; Ghost Slayer (May multi class may not, currently undecided). Chaotic Neutral, leaning towards good but we shall see. Come up with the idea of an arrogant, soldier of light that uses the powers of darkness to fight the darkness. 

Basics of personality are someone who believes themselves superior, so it is their responsibility to protect those weaker than they are, and because of this they believe that they are morally allowed to decide what they believe is good or evil and react accordingly. (Think Daenerys)

DnD,user10001110101ope,7,"(Rant) Need Campaign Advice I‚Äôm playing in a campaign with some people from my college (now on discord and roll 20) and I LOVE the game...but feel like my group might not work out for me if I can‚Äôt work out how it‚Äôs making me feel. I‚Äôm fairly new, I‚Äôve played in a few campaigns before and am pretty familiar with the rules, but can be some what of a people pleaser. I enjoy roll playing and love combat, but feel very singled out by my current group. 

Sometimes it seems like they don‚Äôt take what I have to say as seriously as everyone else. For example, I will suggest a solution to a puzzle or problem and be shut down until it is a last resort, and then when it ends up being the solution they blow it off by saying things like ‚Äúwow how could no one have seen that before‚Äù even though I had. My character will work for entire sessions to complete things and members of my group will (sometimes quite literally) snatch what I‚Äôve worked for away from me. 

This has been going on for awhile now, and it‚Äôs just starting to build up on me. If I make a mistake on roll20 (like pressing the wrong button on accident) they will lose their patience very quickly. I know I should speak up but I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm over reacting. On top of this, when someone makes a joke (which is usually funny) I‚Äôll laugh along, but then be singled out by someone else saying that I‚Äôm definitely uncomfortable, even when I wasn‚Äôt (until they said that). Sometimes, they will talk about using my characters attributes or weapons without even asking my characters permission or opinion. (For general example: ‚Äúwe‚Äôll use their weapon to open that‚Äù) 

I am the only girl in my group, I don‚Äôt know if this is the cause of some of these problems or if I just need to stand up for myself more. Everyone in the campaign is between 19-23. If anyone has any advice or has experienced something like this please tell me how you went about expressing how you felt or what you ended up doing! Thanks a ton.",1

DnD,spideyismywingman,5,"What is your favourite 5e module? Quick confession: I used to look down on the official books for D&amp;D campaigns. I'd never played one until relatively recently, and I had it in my head that by default they would force a railroad style of DMing on the game, forcing the players from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 without any possibility for PC-directed adventures. I know the DM can always add new things in, but I essentially expected that by the end of the first few sessions the book would be all but irrelevant as players had decided their own fates and the DM would be winging it from that point on. It was a completely unfounded snap judgement, but I've been playing D&amp;D for the better part of a decade now and I've only ever run or played in homebrew campaigns. 

Well, a friend was showing me some details from Rise of Tiamat the other day, and I was really impressed. I won't give spoilers for those who don't want them, but there was more latitude for growth and unique plot developments than I'd expected. As I'm about to start an online game for a group of newbies, I thought this would be a good opportunity to try out a module for the first time.

DnD,BackgroundBreak7,4,"How can i be a better DM? Hi Reddit! Throwaway account since my players lurk here. Also please forgive me, english isn‚Äôt my first language. 

I am a DM for an online campaign that‚Äôs been on and off going on for about 18 months. We just started a new Campaign in March and things have been going alright. However, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling from my head that I am doing a bad job as a Dm. I‚Äôm not very used to long form campaigns‚Äî my first two years as a Dm largely were one shots. I only have one other long form campaign under my belt and that was abandoned halfway. 

Mainly, I feel like I am wasting my player‚Äôs time when I Dm. That my worlds are poorly built, the NPCs aren‚Äôt believeable, and that i am railroading my players to do things. I know for a fact that these aren‚Äôt true (most of the time), but it‚Äôs really difficult to shake off that self doubt, you know?

I find it perculiar, since I don‚Äôt feel these things when I am playing with my other group (once an in person game, now online due to global circumstance). The only true difference between the two is group size (the one that was once irl is about half the size of the one always online) and how well I know the people (my very close childhood friends vs online friends I‚Äôve known for about 18 months). 

These feelings (I guess DM anxiety?) has caused a lack of motivation on my part when it comes to world building, prepping for sessions, etc, etc, as I never feel like I will be able to fulfill my own standards. The game, though relativelt new, has already begun to lose it‚Äôs spark for me. I want to continue Dming for these people, but I‚Äôm finding it very hard to.

So Reddit, i leave you with this question: is there a way I can be a better Dm for everyone involved? AKA, does anyone have any solutions that have worked for them when it comes to DM anxiety and creating a fun game for everyone? I just want to be confident when it comes to running games again, but lately I haven‚Äôt been at all.",1
DnD,TheSunkenPirate,2,"[DM] Created my first homebrew game for my kids Just wanted to share my experience of last weekend. Sorry if this doesn't fit here. 

Last week I've been hard at work trying to create a simplified version of DnD to play with my kids (ages 4 and 6). 
I created the game and characters based on their favorite pastime: dinosaurs. Taking some inspiration from the lego jurassic world game on character abilities and 'dinosaur enemies'. 

For example: taking flash pictures causes 'dizziness damage' or 'compies' attacking by jumping all over you. 
If they defeated the dinosaur, it was captured instead of killed. Made it more age appropriate and avoided some tears I believe. 

Overall it was a great experience! We played over 2 hours straight! And everyone continued playing and participating! They added to the story where possible and even tried role play (where did they hit the dinosaur or posing for silly pictures).

It was a great way to interact with them and for them to use their imagination and working with numbers (adding, comparing). Just a great time for the entire family.

DnD,BlademasterBanryu,3,"[OC] DMing: Seeking help brainstorming an interesting optional challenge for a short campaign's 'hard mode' ending So here's the rundown.

I'm running a short shipwreck campaign where four Lv4 PCs are stranded on a tropical beach with an assisting NPC companion (Lv8, but not around all the time a la Gandalf in The Hobbit). I've worked out most of the details and possible endings of the campaign, but there's one thing I have yet to think of, and am completely at a loss for in the idea department; my general line of thought is a sort of challenge, or test of body/spirit/will, facilitated by this powerful elemental who serves as a sort of neutral-aligned demigod for the region (he controls the tides that are keeping the players shipwrecked). 

This would be sort of the 'hard mode' ending for the campaign, so something with a substantial amount of risk for this party (possibly sans the Lv8 NPC) would be preferred, enough to possibly scare them away from attempting this but also rewarding enough to make it worth considering (I have narrative incentive for that aspect, at the very least). I'd prefer not to have it simply be a combat encounter against a beefed-up elemental, since the entity isn't exactly antagonistic, but that is my fallback plan if I don't get something more interesting like I'd prefer.

My dad is an OG 1e/2e player and has recently gotten my brother and I into it. We're almost done with the Lost Mines of Phandelver and it's been a really great way to entertain ourselves during quarantine. Before we started playing, he created characters for us based on our personalities, and me being the family hippy, he created me a wood elf druid. Since he's our DM, he had us create a second character to play with to keep the game from running too slowly. Since I've wanted to get a little more into the game, I've been trying to create a better backstory for both characters and context for how they've met.  I think the storytelling is one of the most fun aspects of the game!! :) 

To condense it as much as possible, I wanted my druid to come from an ancient and secluded religious group called the Elashi, who worship 5e goddess, Selune. I wasn't sure if there are any rules/unspoken rules about creating a religious group/culture that isn't cannon to the game? My second character is a tabaxi rogue, an orphaned daughter of slaves, and a now criminal-for-hire. She was commissioned to steal an ancient relic of the Elashi for a historian- I was going to have my two characters meet that way?

 After this encounter they'd continue down the road, and start to strangely feel sleepy again, and wake up in a dungeon cell with their equipment on the end of the jail room. Easily scaping out of the jails and now with their equipment, they find themselves on a castle, many rooms to explore with a few enemies of weak wisps, an animated statue and animated books, hints on to what the castle is for and who is the person who kidnaped them are and why and the MacGuffin in one room. If they press ""the big red button"" the magic that holds the castle's bricks together will start to fade, and they'll have a ""countdown"" to leave the castle before it crumbles to the ground with them (at least make them feel like that, don't want a TPK on session 1), leaving the castle and seeing that it invisible until it falls to ruins, ending near where they were but now with common magic items, gold, the MacGuffin, a mystery and a sense of danger.",1

DnD,DocKosmosis,9,"Maybe Unpopular Opinion: Many people say kenku when they really just mean Aarakocra Let me start by saying that of course anyone is allowed to make their own characters and run their own games however they like, I don't really care the much, this is just minor pet peeve I have.

&amp;#x200B;

So many times I see artwork of people's characters and it's an avian humanoid that they're calling a kenku. Sometimes it's not even a raven, and the op will talk about them talking and or flying. I don't know if it's a case of people not knowing what aarakocra are or what but most of the time you could just call the character an aarakocra and it would fit better. I like both aarakocra and kenku but a kenku's whole gimic is the mimicry and flightlessness, and if you aren't using those, why not make an aarakocra?

Again, I don't really care all that much about what people do in their own game, if it makes it fun for them so be it, this is just something I see fairly often that I thought I'd comment on.",1

I‚Äôm trying to write my very first one shot and I‚Äôm so excited! My group of players love role play, so I‚Äôm trying to find ways to solve problems other than combat. The premise of my campaign is that the son of a noble has been kidnapped, due to the mother‚Äôs dad being in gambling debt to the Zhentarim for an underground casino. The players will eventually find out that there is a 10,000 gp ransom for the child‚Äôs safe return. The ‚Äúvillain‚Äù just wants his money back but doesn‚Äôt care how he obtains it, but he doesn‚Äôt like to resort to violence unless he is attacked. 
Here‚Äôs my question: is there any other way my players might be able to get the child back without resorting to combat or paying 10,000gp? I‚Äôm fine with running combat but I want to give them options if they‚Äôre stuck.

DnD,VacantPilot64,6,"I character idea help pls So, normally I can come up with a character idea super easy for any campaign, buuut, this campaign is a little different.

Some info about the setting: The land is mainly inhabited by humans, elves, and gnomes who have their own little bit of land. Magic is feared and hated as it is wild and uncontrollable and has killed many civilians. Mages are actively hunted and killed so a character that uses magic is mostly out of the question. Also, it is a godless land, the land and its people have been through some really tough times and when the people asked for divine help, none came, so the people don't really believe in gods, as gods have never helped them before.

So here's catch, I (currently) in a sort of writers block for character ideas, I do have a main character i'm using, but the only backup character I have hunts magic users and at least half my party use magic (1 is from a different world, 2 from different countries, and the last one idk about), so I can't really use a guy who hunts magic users in this party. I'd prefer to stay away from a magic user as well as a cleric or paladin for my backup, but idk what I particularly want, for my backup character. 

If y'all have any ideas please share, I'm happy to answer any questions and stuff. As stated previously, I can be quite savvy when it comes to making characters but i'm in a kind of writers block and would like your ideas. :)",1

So, we just started our campaign consisting of a Tiefling rogue (son), Aasimir warlock(son), dragonborn fighter(son), Goliath barbarian (son), Firbolg druid(fiance), and me a Ghostwise Halfling Bard. 5 mins into the game when we are getting each other. The rogue fails miserably in trying to pick pocket me. I take offense and in my insults I weave vicious mockery into my words and deal half of his life in damage. He backs away and doesn't fight. But my Bard does not trust him anymore and wants to teach him a lesson. 

Here comes the fun part. 

Because I'm a Ghostwise I can telepathically communicate with someone within 30 feet of me but no one at the table knows this. (Thank god because my son would try to meta this) I tell the rouge telepathically before we go to sleep that (texting the DM so he doesn't know its from me) ""I'm watching him and he better go to sleep with his hands in his pockets tonight."" He announced that he pulled his blanket out of his bag wrapped himself up and went to bed with his hands on his pockets. As you can assume I'm happy about this and now I'm in it for the long haul. 

I plan on through out the game to send him these messages and convince him that he's being talked to by a god. Jarmik to be precise. A god of Generosity and Sharing. I'm going to try to make this rogue the most honest rouge anyone has seen.

DnD,Tanget81,9,"Need desperate and huge help writing my second campaign. Experts and novices alike, please help this poor fool. TL:DR - How can I make a campaign on par with Fools Gold and whatever the hell Zee Bashew is doing over there?

My first campaign was one giant mistake, as expected. I had created a landmass, a few points of interest, an existing political system between the races, etc. but outside of a vague general direction and few toyed with ideas, no real plot. Side quests were limited to ‚Äúgo gather this‚Äù or ‚Äúgo kill these guys‚Äù, not a whole lot in the way of content. It was open world and I tried running it like Skyrim, letting the players do things completely unrestricted, but also without guidance. Obviously it caught fire and burned after I realized exactly how little planning and setup I did compared to what was needed. Which was basically none, not even distinguishable characters. I threw it together in about 12 hours and focused mostly on random encounters and an economy more than anything else. 

Like I said it was a giant mistake that looked full, but really had nothing to it. Real content was made in between sessions and was almost forced as the focus of the campaign for that session. 

Now though, I mostly know what I did wrong and want to try again. My players enjoyed it because it was really all they knew. All greenhorns, so I can‚Äôt go to them for any meaningful help. But after seeing some of Zee Bashews stuff and Dingo Doodles campaign I am inspired to wipe slate and try again, not like they were in the middle of anything ground breaking anyway. 

I‚Äôve got a general plot and am flushing out a few endings with a different friend of mine (part time writer), but I still have no idea what to add in the way of side content, world building, or even appropriate enemy scaling and loot drops. Hell, the only thing I do have is the opening sequence into the story and the general premise of the plot (twists and endings pending. If having the main idea of the plot will help with ironing this out let me know and I‚Äôll edit it in).

I can tell a narrative like nobody‚Äôs business but when it comes to world building anything outside of the main characters focus, I find myself sorely lacking. I could have one giant rail roaded campaign but I don‚Äôt want that, they don‚Äôt want that. That‚Äôs not a fun way of playing dnd. 

I‚Äôve seen quite a few guides on homebrewing campaigns but mostly focus on pacing and dragging out the story to fit the players attention spans, and while that‚Äôs all fine and well there‚Äôs more the a campaign than that. How can I make a campaign on par with Fools Gold and whatever the hell Zee Bashew is doing over there? Mostly, I just need ideas and inspiration.

The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

Following the logic behind that, if a monster attempted to shove a PC prone, could the PC choose to make an acrobatics check to use the momentum of the shove or ability that would knock them prone to instead tumble back to their feet?",1

**Sorcerous Origin: Haemolyte** 

Most sorcerers carry a magic in their blood that prompts grandness and adventure in their life. Haemolytes know that magic can give blood a life of its own. The source of this preternatural will might be the result of a demonic influence, a curse, or a magical exposure on a level too deep to be conscious. Whatever the reason, Haemolytes can tap into the characteristics of lifeblood, be it their own or someone else‚Äôs. 

Haemolytes do not have easy lives. Their magic incurs costs most do not have the stomach to pay, and they are feared and reviled by many who know of their powers. So it is that most either try to keep the nature of their power secret, or are driven to occupy the same fringes as necromancers and hags. Some are seen as prime targets for inclusion in occult rituals, used either as sacrifices or vessels for horrific gods.

**Haemolyser Features**

   

Sorcerer level - Feature

1st - Blood Magic, Roiling Blood

3rd - Bloodhound

6th - Haemovore

14th - Blood Fortifier

 18th - Violent Hemorrhage 

**Blood Magic**

Your Awakened blood gives you a glimpse of how to channel your own vitality into magical processes. Your casting ability is flexible: It can be either Constitution or Charisma. Whichever you choose, the modifier interacts with your spell save DC and spell attack modifier as normal.

**Roiling Blood**

At first level, you instinctively know the spell Roiling Blood. It can be cast either with a spell slot or for sorcery points. The number of Sorcery Points spent determine its level, but cannot exceed the level of your highest spell slot for your character level. While it is described in the context of a spell it is an ability. 

**Roiling Blood**

1st level necromancy

Casting time: 1 Action, or 1 bonus action if cast with Sorcery Points

Range: Self

Components: M (your own fresh blood)

Duration: 5 minutes

A whirling force visible as a splash of blood surrounds you like a cyclone. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, you may spend a reaction to have the force lash out at the attacker. The force has your spell casting modifier as its attack and damage bonus and deals 1d4 piercing damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of second level and up, or more than one Sorcery Point, the temporary HP increases by 5 for each additional sorcery point or spell level above 1st. The damage also increases by 1d4 the same way.

Roiling Blood alternate text:

If you are damaged by an attack, as a bonus action you can call on the self preservation instinct of your own blood to defend its vessel for one hour. At the cost of a spell slot or sorcery points you can summon a crimson entity that surrounds you like a cyclone. It has its own hit points and will absorb half of any incoming damage that hits you until those hit points reach zero, at which point the Roiling Blood is dispelled. As a reaction your Roiling Blood can lash out at an enemy that struck you with a melee attack. Its attack and damage bonus is your spell casting stat modifier. 

Its HP is equal to 5 times the level of spell slot or number of Sorcery Points used to summon it.

Its damage roll is 1d4 for each level of spell slot of number of Sorcery points used to summon it.

This ability‚Äôs effects end after five minutes, if dispelled, or its HP drops to zero.

**Bloodhound**

By consuming a small amount of another‚Äôs essence you can gain insight to their life. As an action you may consume the blood or flesh of another creature and learn its damage vulnerabilities, damage resistances, damage immunities and condition immunities. You Also gain advantage on Wisdom rolls to read the creature or track it. This ability remains active for a day, and cannot be active against more than one creature at a time.

This ability cannot activate against constructs, elementals, or undead.

**Haemovore**

If Roiling blood is active when you reduce a creature‚Äôs HP to zero, its temporary HP increases by an amount proportional to the body mass of the victim. Tiny creatures add 1 hit point, small add 2, medium add 4 and large add 8. Giant and larger creatures add 16. 

This ability cannot activate against constructs, elementals, or undead.

**Blood Fortifier**

You can exert enough will over your own blood magic to will it to attack for you. If Roiling Blood is active, you can use an action to have it make a melee attack for you. 

**Violent Hemorrhage**

Your blood‚Äôs will is easily as strong as your own. If you are forced asleep, incapacitated, or made unconscious, your Roiling Blood activates at the highest level you can cast. It will attack in your defence, with no regard to friend or foe, until you are again conscious and can re-exert your will over it.",1

So, I'm going to be in my first campaign in a couple weeks, and I'm pretty sure I want to be a druid. Upon looking at the circles and whatnot, I'm really interested in the circle of spores or the circle of wildfire. The problem as I understand it is, these are from non-basic source materials (e.g. Unearthed Arcana) and might be a pain to implement into a game that's otherwise using just the player's handbook stuff, considering that's all the DM owns.

I've asked her how she would feel about that, and she pretty much said tentative yes, depending on what the stuff used would be, but I haven't gotten more than that (she's slow to respond and initially I only asked if non-basic stuff could be included, didn't go into specifics at the time).

I guess what I'm asking is - how do I make this the least intrusive/obnoxious that I can? It's her first time DMing and the last thing I want to do is make it a pain in the ass to include me. How could I implement stuff from other sources in a way that she wouldn't have to do any extra legwork, or would that be impossible? Should I just buy the source material for her, which I don't really mind doing, or could I use it without necessarily owning the material? It looks like we're going to be using DNDbeyond for character sheets and whatnot.

So we jump in and we're now 4 weeks in on the Lost Mine of Phandelver and everyone is loving it. In those 4 weeks I've bought the core books, several sets of dice, and giant graph paper for maps. I considered printing the maps poster size at Walgreen's for $25 each but that would be ridiculous. 

So I saw a few posts about mounting a TV under a table and putting the maps on the TV. Now I'm seriously considering getting a cheap 42"" TV and building a case for it. 

I know this is out of control. We aren't even out of the Redbrand Hideout yet and I'm ready to spend $500 on this hobby.

DnD,Dovahreddit,17,"My Party Generated a Tsunami At Second Level - 5e Some background:

My party had a run-in with a band of pirate ships, and were being pursued by them after beating off boarders. The wind changed on the fourth day of them fleeing, and their ship sustained too much damage to be fixed at sea. The party leader, call him R, decided to fire one of their mounted ballistae at the enemy's caravels. Problem: the ballista only had a maximum range of 1.000 feet, and the caravel was 2 kilometres (1.6 mi.) away from them. So R had the brilliant idea of *attaching explosives to the ballista* to extend the range by creating a shockwave behind the bolt to extend the range. I set the check as a Intelligence check w/o proficiency bonus, and DC 19 (cuz making an impromptu gun is hard, k?). And R got a 3 on explosive construction, and a 8 on the attack roll. This led to the ballista detonating spontaneously and then igniting the alchemist's fire in the cargo hold, leading to an explosion with an estimated detonation force of 15 mt of TNT, which generated a tsunami 212 metres in height, roughly 900 feet tall. This obliterated the opposing pirate ship, and subsequently the CAPITAL OF A NATION in the tsunami's course, killing not 10, not 100, but \~100.000 people, and my players are second level.",1

DnD,mine1UPSyours,5,"Javelin of Lightning consensus; magic attack or just piercing damage? So there has been a fairly even response to my previous post so I decided to make a poll to determine a more accurate consensus. Previous post was as follows...

So since the javelin is not lightning when it hits the target (it transforms back) does that mean that the bolded sentences in RAW is regardless of saying the magic word? 

As in is it always 1d6 ranged damage and 4d6 lightning damage to the intended target on a successful hit?

or

is it always 1d6 ranged damage on hit?

(yes, I understand that the creatures in-between the target and me only get hit when it transforms into lightning, but does it always do 4d6 lightning damage to the intended target?)

Rule As Written

This Javelin is a Magic Weapon. When you hurl it and speak its Command Word (Penelope), it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The Lightning Bolt turns back into a Javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon Attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the Javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.

The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the Javelin can still be used as a Magic weapon.

DnD,BartandLees,2,"Ideas on implementing a trouble system in Cities In my campaign the players have side quests that require the players to perform various illegal activities that also give the players a certain level of ""*Heat*"" (*imagine the star system from GTA5*). All of this is in 5th Edition D&amp;D.

For example - failing to persuade guards about tax collection dates (and come up with a reasonable reason to ask about it) gives the party +1 Heat.

Failing to succeed on a sleight of hand check to steal from a Governess has a consequence of throwing the players in jail, whereupon the escape gives the party +3 Heat.

Finally the last example is kidnapping a guard for whatever purpose gives the party +5 Heat.

&amp;#x200B;

What could be some fun or immersive consequences for illegal actions in this city that is related to the heat system I've proposed? Here are my ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

|Heat Boundry|Consequence|
|:-|:-|
|0|No consequence.|
|1 - 3|Spot checks on edge of city, wanted posters scattered around, citizens are fairly mistrusting.|
|4 - 6|More detailed and accurate wanted posters, citizens scout out for players, shop-keepers are hesitant to sell, guards arrest or kill on sight.|
|7+|City locksdown and guards look thoroughly through the city for the players, citizens actively reveal party to guards, guards kill on sight, possible bounties, and city is effectively unusable until some activity is performed to lower heat, e.g paying off bounty or serving some jail time.|

This idea may not be entirely balanced, but I'm curious if there is an existing template or previous thread where somebody has discussed this idea in greater detail.",1

DnD,DM_lvl_1,34,"My DM is nerfing my sneak attack, any advice would be appreciated. Let me start at the beginning. I started playing in a mostly RP, mostly homebrew 5e campaign with a new DM, who is also a close friend. We did not have a session 0. I am playing a stout halfling

So during the previous session yesterday, my DM changed a few rules literally in the middle of the session. The reason he changed the rules is because he is used to playing Pathfinder, with many rules regarding opportunity attacks and sneak attack. 

Regarding opportunity attacks, he changed it so that you provoke an attack whenever you pass through a space threatened by an opponent. Not just when you leave a threatened space.

Regarding sneak attack, he is changing it so that I can ONLY get the bonus damage while flanking (not just having a person within 5 feet). Obviously I'm upset about this, since I'm a melee rogue and I can't get my bonus damage nearly as often as I would normally be able to. 

Do you have any advice on how I should approach my DM about this?",1
DnD,tooodifferent,4,"How to properly approach character development as a DM? Hi all, I've been stewing over this question for a while now in anticipation of the next campaign I am DM'ing. When I talk about character development, I mainly mean the actual **personal growth** of the character, not the character's story arc.

As a player, I've played through great campaigns that have fully integrated backstories into the main story arcs and by the end of the campaign, most characters have resolved their goals, but I can't think of many times when a character has had personal growth through a story. Most characters players create seem to have pretty stable personalities, the only growth they experience is typically through leveling. They'll approach most situations the same way throughout the whole campaign, staying true to what their characters would do, which isn't necessarily bad, but... it's like they've already reached the peak of their character growth and the only thing they have left to do in the campaign is to level up and reach the end of the campaign. The campaign is moved forward through story progression, not necessarily character progression, if that makes sense.

So, has anyone had experience as a DM in incorporating situations in which a character may have personal growth? For example, perhaps a character has a certain flaw they need to overcome in order to reach their ideal? It seems a bit hard to balance because you still want these flaws to be impactful and be roleplayed effectively, but true character growth is organic and happens over time, not instantaneously. It also doesn't seem like it would work if the players themselves aren't really looking for these opportunities to grow their characters. This question may seem a little convoluted after writing all of this and at this point I may just be transcribing my thoughts as they come into my head, but hopefully someone is able to understand what I am trying to ask.

If it helps, I began thinking about this when reflecting on what I liked most about stories that drew me in, whether they were fantasy or not. After rewatching A:TLA, I realized it was always the character growth I appreciated a lot and being able to see these characters transform. Zuko in A:TLA, Walter White in BB, Jaime Lannister up until the final season of GoT. It would be cool to have this sort of character transformation in my campaign, I'm just having difficulty thinking about what this would look like. Apologies for the long wall of text.",1

For the race I've picked Warforged
For the first 2 levels I'm going Cleric, specifically Forge Cleric, this gives me heavy armor proficiency, a starting set of chain mail, and shield, and blessing of the forge, which adds a +1 to AC, as well as giving me access to the spell shield of faith. With the chainmail, shield, blessing of the forge, and integrated protection from being a warforged, I've got a starting AC of 20.
Once we get to lvl 3, the rest of the levels go into Artificer, and it'll be Battle Smith.
Once we hit Lvl 4 we can pick 2 infusions, I'm picking enhanced weapon, and defense, so AC is going up to 21. At lvl 5 we get martial weapon proficiency, so we can switch to a warhammer we can also use Int as our melee weapon stat instead of Str, we get the Shield spell, and we get our Steel Defender, which is going to be our flanking companion, getting us consistent advantage, plus as a reaction the steel defender can impose disadvantage on attacks made by an enemy within 5ft not aimed at it. At lvl 6 we get our first ASI, but we'll skip that to pick up the sentinel feat, now if an enemy is flanked by me and the steel defender it can either attack me at disadvantage, or the steel defender, and I get to take an attack.

DnD,Stressgoblin,2,"Seeking opinions Hello everyone, I have a question as something that happened in my campaign isn‚Äôt sitting right with me.

I played a ranger in my most recent campaign. My party had just finished defeating a young dragon (we were level 5) and we were contemplating how to get off the roof of the tower we fought on. There was a group of potentially dangerous orcs at the base of the tower that we managed to sneak past initially to get to the dragon. We were pretty hurt and out of potions and healing spells. When we looted the dragon‚Äôs den there was a broom of flying, which gave us the idea to fly off the tower located on a cliff in order to avoid the orcs. The broom held up to 400 pounds, which would have easily carried 3 of us, but I decided to go with our wizard during her feather fall spell. We considered just taking turns on the broom, but we didn‚Äôt want to split the party in our weekend state for several rounds with potentially dangerous foes near us. After talking this out our cleric and bard started off first on the broom and the wizard and I jumped off of the tower after. Because our wizard choose to simply fall off the ledge without jumping away from the tower (I chose to jump out and away instead of just falling straight down) she hit a cliff ledge 20 feet down and took the damage for it (she was still conscious). I didn‚Äôt hit the ledge since I jumped out. The wizard hadn‚Äôt casted feather fall yet, she was going to cast it about 100 feet down...so I‚Äôm in a free fall several hundred feet in the air and moving at full fall speed. By the time the wizard would be able to get up and back off the ledge I would be too far out of range for feather fall (Which sucks, but makes total sense). Trying to think of how to save my character from certain death I ask my DM to allow me to make a grab for the broom with my two party members on it since they are still ahead of me at this point. The DM told me to make a dex saving throw and I rolled a natural 20 for a total of 27 I think. The DM told me I broke the broom and all three of us (me, the cleric and the bard) fell to our deaths (we tried to think of a way to save ourselves, but we were pretty tapped and all wound up dying). This just didn‚Äôt sit right with me. The broom held up to 400 pounds and was a magical item. I hadn‚Äôt even fallen from that great of a height (for D&amp;D) at this point (about 60 feet per my DM). Even with me grabbing the broom we would have easily been under the max weight. I figured if impact damage was a concern I could have grabbed the broom and spun around it before settling on it (my dex was high, so I don‚Äôt think it is out of the realm of possibility). I respect our DM and his calls, but this one just didn‚Äôt sit right. I was just looking for other people‚Äôs opinions since I am still kind of new to the game. The reason I‚Äôm a little concerned it wasn‚Äôt a fair call is because our DM has been wanting to take a break from the game for a bit (which we all supported as we didn‚Äôt want to stress him out. We all agreed to finish up this encounter with the dragon and then step away from this campaign for a while until things got less stressful for our DM). I am wondering if he did this as a way to completely end this campaign with no real hope for continuing it in the future, when asked about it our DM got a little defensive about his calls and kind of ended the conversation without settling any concerns. I didn‚Äôt bring it up again.

The mind flayers used this against him, and made him watch the whole ordeal again. When it was over, our Tobias merged with ""memory Tobias"", and suddenly the insane, haunted barbarian wasn't crazy anymore. 

As soon as his sanity was restored, the sound of children playing could be heard down the hall. We tried to stop him, but Tobias went into the room... And found them playing catch with a mild flayer while his wife happily watched. The mind flayer stopped, picked an axe up off the floor, and handed it to Tobias. 

""The nightmare ends when you kill them again."" 

The mind flayer disappeared, leaving him with a terrible choice. Tobias, having seen enough horrors to last an eternity, laid down his axe.

""I can't hurt them again"", he insisted. We offered to do the deed for him, but he responded that, if we tried, he'd use lethal force to stop us.

This is where I come in. 

The minotaur paladin kneels in front of the halfling, taking his head in my hand, I tell him he made the right choice...

Then I bury my sword, to the hilt, in the chest of the halfling. This was not a malicious act. He was my best friend, and I did this to end his suffering. 

As life drained from Tobias, he thanked me for saving him from the impossible choice, and was happy he was amongst family at the end, both his blood relatives, and his friends. 

The halfling went limp, the nightmare faded, and it was over. My best friend was dead. 

We dug a grave, of course, by hand. ""No magic"", insisted the gunslinger. ""We bury him properly"". As we laid him in tge grave, the cleric consecrated and hallowed tge ground. Sunshine beams eternal in that section of the Underdark now, and none may disturb his rest. 

I brushed his hair from his face one last time and laid my shield on top of him. We buried him deep, stuck his axes, in a cross shape, as a headstone. 

We left that place, sunshine beaming on newly sacred ground, and continued towards the mind flayer base.

All they really succeeded in doing was making us angry. They're going to realise very soon that they should've left my friend alone.

I'm coming for them.",1

Like so many people, I‚Äôve been zooming weekly with friends from my schooldays for quizzes, games and to generally be in contact during these mad times. We‚Äôve considered in the past, but only a few of us have played and it‚Äôs never quite worked to all get together. Since one infamous new years a couple years back including storytime where the word ‚Äòwand‚Äô was swapped for ‚Äòwilly‚Äô, Harry Potter has been a fun shared thing for us. The other morning I realised that a Hogwarts based campaign was the perfect way to get new players involved and give us a way to hangout without yet another quiz. Going into the details now, so any of my players turn away! (Talking to you Louis‚Ä¶)

*My Post-HP Lore*

(I‚Äôm treating the original HP books as canon, but still not sacred. All over HP world books etc. like fantastic beasts will just be used to mine for fun creatures/adventures/locations etc. but not held canon)

Hogwarts has changed dramatically since the infamous battle with death eaters and Voldemort himself on its grounds. Mrs Mcgonagall reluctantly took over as headmistress to steer it through these tumultuous times. With many student deaths over that period the population was already down, and further hit when many wizarding families decided Hogwarts was not safe (even with Voldemort dead) and so opted to send their children abroad or homeschool. This lead to a mass increase in muggleborn intake, coinciding with more scholarships.

This led to a dramatic shift in culture. With muggleborns no longer a minority, much of the prejudice was erased by sheer exposure. This was firmly cemented by Louis Brent, the first ever muggleborn Slytherin seeker. She was brave, arrogant, beautiful: Slytherin through and through. She won Slytherin the quidditch cup three years in a row. She was herself a bully, but somebody‚Äôs birth was no longer an okay target (well, unless they weren‚Äôt rich of course). To this day only the crudest Slytherin would ever call somebody a moodblood, and they would be most likely met by cold stares even in their own dormitory.

The increase in muggle also meant an increase in tech. This helped further reduce people‚Äôs dismissal of Muggles, as the technology had developed to the point of near magic itself. Certainly, an iPhone 3 far outstripped anything a first year could accomplish with their wands. There was now a sense of pride to be from a people who‚Äôd done so much without magic. The staff‚Äôs obliviousness to technology meant they were totally unprepared for the inevitable that would follow.

It was Ellie Blep, a muggleborn Hufflepuff, whose magical Vines first went viral. Most of the young muggle world had seen it far before Hogwart‚Äôs staff or the Ministry of Magic had even the slightest inkling of its existence. Luckily, aside from a handful of conspiracy theorists (who were probably for once more or less correct) all the muggles assumed it was some cool, home CGI. The Ministry of Magic asked McGonagall to step down and installed a talented muggleborn witch who would understand the tech and know how to deal with it. She was the youngest headmistress since Hogwart‚Äôs founding, at only 47, and the first muggleborn in centuries.

Headmistress Granger moved into Hogwarts like a storm. First of all, charms were added to the magical trace which kept Hogwarts hidden so that all technology failed within its bounds. In response a group of rebellious, Fred and George-esque students began secretly meeting to try and overcome the limitations and once again return, at least to themselves, their access to phones and the internet. In response to rumours of this group, Headmistress Granger (perhaps ironically, given her history with Umbridge) set up a club of students whose role was to try and outpace the cell of magical hacker rebels by predicting what technology they might attempt next and designing charms which would block that particular approach. This has resulted in a strange sort of reverse-arms race, with both groups trying to find even older technology than the last. In actual fact, Headmistress Granger is secretly aware of both groups and has occasionally provided indirect assistance to both to keep it balanced. She believes it makes for a far better educational project than most classes, and the students would probably be far less keen if they didn‚Äôt think they were being rebellious or righteous as they honed they magic.

The main other change since Granger‚Äôs beginning a few years back is that house elves now all have the choice of a uniform and living wage for the work they provide. This has created a stark split amongst them, between traditionalists and those that accept the better conditions. (Just to say, think it‚Äôs super dodgy that Rowling designed a slave race that preferred to remain slaves. In a kids book. Wtf boomer)

*Reskinning DnD Mechanics for Hogwarts*

All the characters have to be spellcasting classes. So if you want to be a fighter that means being an eldritch knight for example. The one exception to this is one player might be the ‚ÄòMuscle Wizard‚Äô barbarian subclass from The Middle Finger of Vecna. This is a hilarious subclass built on the premise that you have no magic but intimidate everybody into agreeing that you do, and your physical attacks are reskinned as cantrips and spells. Perfect for a squib with rich wizard parents who want except they‚Äôre a squib.

Everybody will be human unless they have a good narrative explanation for an alternative, e.g. goliath = Hagrid equivalent, limited changeling = Tonks

Armour will have to be reasonable given that they‚Äôre students. So leather armour from quidditch for example, maybe they could steel a suit of armour, but I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre sneaking that past everybody. Other than that I‚Äôm drawing a lot from this redditor‚Äôs post from a few years back:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/6bxw35/harry_potter_dd_guide_a_simple_reskin/

Spells are reskinned to fit Harry Potter, e.g. alohamora = knock, light = lumos/nox, avada kedavra = power word kill. Druids are animaguses. Creatures will also be stolen from the HP wikis, fantastic beasts and I will use the reskins again from the reddit post above, e.g. in HP goblins are more like dwarves.

*Hogwartian Narratives*

*Session zero*

Session zero needs to bring them together despite being from different houses. It should reference lots of HP stuff to be fun/nostalgic for the players whilst being its own distinct narrative and fitting within a DnD framework of encounters.

We start in the first few days of the Christmas holidays. Our players are the only first years still here, either they are boarding over Christmas or their parents just haven‚Äôt picked them up yet. Sat having breakfast at the one dining table left out over the holidays, they probably start sat with the older kids from their own houses. They are summoned by a now elderly Professor Sprout. Three years back, Headmistress Granger began a tradition for first year students staying at Hogwarts over holidays, with no exams to focus their attention on, because she remembered the loneliness of a certain friend of hers over those times. The students are to help with the preparations for Christmas, and are even allowed to introduce their own ideas.

Sprout shows them the dancing Christmas tress in the herbology greenhouse, which jiggle quite proficiently to rhythmic music. When she steps out, they will see a perfectly pristine dolls house amongst the muck of the greenhouse. Either from their curiosity or a DM nudge the door is opened and the cute stick insect thing from fantastic beasts will run out and sprint away. It will have the statblock of a quickling, so it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll stop it. Either of their own volition, or on Sprouts‚Äôs angry bidding, they will head out to retrieve it. Tracing its tiiiiny footsteps of the snow leads them into the forbidden forest. If they are too law abiding to enter, and get a teacher, they will be sent in alongside an elderly Hagrid.

Their first encounter will be with a host of sprites, basically the blue things from Gilderoy Lockharts class. These will be many but low damage low HP, probs based on actual sprite statblock. Further on they will see flickering flames. If Hagrid is with them, he‚Äôll step in front to lead so we can get rid of him and give all the combat fun to the kids. As they get close the flames snuff out. Without warning the leading person‚Äôs greatest fear springs out at them and attacks. If Hagrid is with them it‚Äôll be Voldemort and he‚Äôll faint outright. Eventually, though hopefully with a bit of suspense, the players will realise it‚Äôs a boggart. Hopefully during character design I‚Äôll milk out each character‚Äôs greatest fear, otherwise I can ask in each moment. For my DnD boggart it can transform once for each person it encounters into their fear. In each form, e.g. giant spider, it will keep all the normal stats but only have one HP. So on a hit it swirls together before reforming as somebody else‚Äôs fear. Only once all the characters‚Äô fears have been defeated will there be only a swirling, chaotic cloud which can be distilled with light. 

After the boggart‚Äôs retreat they will spot the little twiggling cowering on the other side of the clearing with the acorn it came to the forest to fetch. The acorn is bigger then it‚Äôs body, so it is now very slow and easy to grab. The reason they saw flames was because the twiggling bumped into the boggart, and its greatest fear is fire. They return to Sprout triumphant!

*Other narratives*

Over the years they will have numerous little adventures, like in HP or a regular DnD campaign. Some of these will feed into the big meta-narrative however.

One will involve them coming out of the room of requirement, having discovered it in some previous session, to find Hogwarts totally empty. A man performed some huge magic to banish everybody, but the room shielded them. He has come to kill Fawkes the phoenix and take its heart, as it is the only cure for his dying husband. A moral conundrum indeed.

At another point I will use one of the narratives from that redditor‚Äôs post. A timeturner accident sends them back to the founding of Hogwarts where they discover Helga and Salazaar the most sympathetic in their response to muggles and witches alike dying during the witch burnings. This hopefully provides some interesting conflict, as Gryffindor and Ravenclaw are clearly the most arrogant and callous and Salazaar just wants to stop the conflict and protect muggles and wizards alike.

Eventually it becomes clear that a lot of their adventures were in fact coordinated by a distant relative of Godric Gryffindor. He believes that magic should be exposed to the muggles and, since it nearly was with Voldemort, has been working to cause some huge event in Hogwarts in the hope muggles which catch on and respond sympathetically to the magic, as it is in the hands of schoolkids. He figured the ministry or Gringotts, for example, might cause fear and violence from the muggles. This hopefully makes him an interesting, sympathetic villain; even if he takes things too far sometimes.

His final big plot is to aid a group of wild creatures in overrunning Hogwarts so that the trace is lowered to allow Ministry assistance, whilst informing Muggle media of something big about to unfold. He knows once it‚Äôs online, no number of obliviate spells will help the ministry in shutting it down. However what he doesn‚Äôt realise is that he himself was being manipulated. Muggles have so encroached on the wild that most magical creatures are becoming extinct or endangered. Even if the try to defend themselves and their territory, the ministry intervenes to prevent muggle deaths and the exposure of magic. This has lead to an unlikely alliance, ranging from centaurs to hags to giants etc. Their plan it to clear out Hogwarts entirely and make it into a sort of sanctuary where they can live in peace from the muggles, protected by the trace and with fortifications to fend off, on a united front, ministry forces.

This will make the final confrontation not some evil BBEG but a horde of magical beasts of varied allignments and abilities swarming into Hogwarts and a confused Gryffindor. They‚Äôll be either defending Hogwarts like in the book version with magical plants and charmed armour not the crappy film force field thing or trying to retake it. Perhaps the evil creatures go further than the more neutral creatures like centaurs are comfortable with. I don‚Äôt know how they would resolve these big questions of habitat destruction and magic exposure as I have no idea what‚Äôs the right move myself! Hopefully that‚Äôs what makes for an interesting finale, maybe they‚Äôll even join the creatures in defending Hogwarts against the ministry.

Okay so yeah, PHEW. That was a long‚Äôn. Even accidentally deleted it and couldn‚Äôt undo/paste to get it back so had to write twice. Hope y‚Äôall find it interesting, would super appreciate feedback and ideas for magical items, creatures, locations and narratives etc. I‚Äôll be properly pitching to them this Friday then kicking off in the coming which

He wanted an actual tank. Like a car with a big cannon.

I was dumbfounded but he explained. He wanted to be an artificer to do this. He wanted to use a long metal tube attached to a base with wheels. He would use a transparent and resistant gate to load a big stone to use as a bullet and something else to use as gunpowder. Then he will cast the spell explosion (previously stored in a spell-storing ring by another party memeber) on the material used as gunpowder causing the stone to be fired like a missile.

After the whole explanation I actually liked the idea and I see potential here. Maybe they want to defeat a big monster as a final boss and they can go on a quest in order to gather the materials to build this tank before attacking the boss.

The second interpritation would allow the claws to harm a litch but not be able to pass the werewolfs resistance.

Hi everyone this is my first time posting here I have never played 5e and only have minor experience with 4e and pathfinder so I‚Äôm pretty much a complete noob. I‚Äôm in process of making a general PC for whenever I actually get to play but I‚Äôm having a hard time with picking a background feature for my Custom background. Basically the idea is he‚Äôs Lawful/Evil rogue who hunts those who break his moral code ( not necessarily laws). I know for my proficiency‚Äôs I‚Äôm getting Perception(keeping eye out for wrongdoing or anyone who he might be looking into), Stealth (pretty clear), Posioners kit, and forgery kit(for those who need ‚Äúspecial‚Äù punishments) but I can‚Äôt figure out what class feature would fit, criminal doesn‚Äôt really work cause he sometimes hunts them making that connection not optimal, Charliton  is interesting with the double identity and the forgery but he doesn‚Äôt really go out scamming so the second identity thing seems off, city watch and those thing also seem off cause he goes by his own laws not the cities as such he sometimes breaks them, the one I found that I‚Äôm kindof liking is Urchin with the Double Movespeed in cities for escaping and hunting criminals and the law. But the rest of Urchin doesn‚Äôt really fit the theme so I‚Äôm trying to see if anyone has a good idea of what kind of background feature would work for this type of ‚ÄúAvenger‚Äù theme",1

DnD,lajas1,8,"New to DnD Hi y'all! I'm wondering what I should do to prepare for a DnD game with my friends. I'm new to it all and would like a little help or pointers.

I guess I should talk about what my experience has been with roleplay stuff. I don't think I've played that much since I like action-oriented type board games/video games, like chess and shooters. (I suck at these but they're still fun.) Well, I did play Skyrim if that counts, but I got pretty confused early on and ended up not liking it at all. (Not because I got confused, but because it got boring.) I also played Dark Souls and have like 100 hours on it and absolutely love it, if that counts. The most I can say about DnD itself is that I liked Community's episodes on the subject.

My friend said to read this thing called a player's handbook, but it's really long and I read slow, and don't have much time to read it because of work and stuff. So if y'all can point me to what to read as a beginner, then that'd be nice. Any help in general would be nice actually lol.

P.S.: I just tagged this under MISC because I didn't know what to actually put it under haha.",1

DnD,P4ramed1c,1,"Encounters that challenge the players as opposed to the characters I've noticed that my players seem to respond to challenges better when they make them think as players as opposed to challenges that only pose difficulty to the characters. For example if you come across a puzzle door that challenges you as a player because it doesnt matter what your character is the door wont open unless you solve the riddle. Contrast this to an encounter that challenges your character but not really you as a player, which would be something like a poorly designed combat encounter. It's still an encounter and you're having to handle it but you could be replaced by a robot halfway through and there would be no difference.

Obvious answers are puzzles, but does anyone have any good encounters that challenge the players creativity but arent just ""solve this riddle"" type stuff?",1

Hi so I have a group of 8 people in the party and as many of us know scheduling dnd can be a hassle as everyone is living there own lives to actually get a time that lines up with most people‚Äôs schedules. (I‚Äôve never had a session with all 8 people in attendance at once) now most of the time I can run a game with 1 or 2 pcs in my control if they‚Äôre not there but we‚Äôve recently had to start doing sessions with about half the party (we‚Äôre all going off to college in the fall and we all agreed that we want to finish out our campaign before then) so to make a long story short what might be some good ways to handle a 3 or 4 player-less pcs that can‚Äôt necessarily leave the party for very long,1
DnD,pcserenity,7,"DM-ing for first time since 1983. Digital Assistance and Tools? Okay, I'm clearly older and go back to growing up when Gygax first released the initial D&amp;D. We literally played before there were polyhedral dice using ""chits"" in dixie cups. As the oldest of our group I was tasked with being the DM and we played solidly for the next 8 or so years, and then a few times sporadically after that until about 1990. 

Flash forward. My wife and our gaming friends group want me to DM a new campaign. I'm willing, but a bit skittish as SO much has changed. THACO is no longer a thing (it appears) though much does seem intact. I also just ordered the 5th Edition ""Special Foil Covers Edition with Slipcase, Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, Monster Manual, DM Screen"".

The biggest question I have is what sort of digital tools should I be looking to use, if any? One player mentioned a dual monitor setup where I run a ""module"" (not even sure they're called that anymore) from my laptop while they see the map slowly reveal on an interactive tablet at the center of their table. Is that real? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm fairly creative and mainly used old modules as a skeleton for much larger adventures creating NPCs, challenges, and so forth, as needed.",1

DnD,SharpShogun,1,"Hmmmm...how the turn tables So, my chaotic good moon elf thief, Daelias is the second most innocent member of my party, personality wise (out of a very aggressive druid, Rexel, a cleric that acts like a warlock, Adric, and a very fat assassin with brain damage, Varis), so I was very suprised when he had to seduce a woman that we suspected was involved in a cult I was hunting, to get information. I rolled a nat 20. I hated the success, but we got a rogue, wizard (and possibly other things) ally, Carah. We get along and, while Adric burned corpses and Varis got molested (don't ask), I learn that she was only trying to reclaim a family heirloom from a store near a suspected cult hideout, which is where we saw her in  our previous adventure.

Later we find a traumatized Varis and Carah offers to lead us to a temple to have him healed by a non-psychotic cleric. Adric came with us to help carry Varis, when we arrived at the temple, the DM was finally sick of Adric's player's s**t (he was a chaotic evil menace that was going to get the whole town turned against us) then had him murdered, RIP psycho. A priest there comments that I am under some sort of spell, and is immediately shut up by Carah. Daelias suspects nothing. Out of game me feels like stabbing her. 

Thus far, despite the fact that she probably used charm on me, Carah has been helping us without issue, though she wouldn't let Rexel (remember him?) stay at her place. She even helped us break into the mayor's (and suspected cult member's) castle, and wants to help us stop the cult. I'm not going to get attached to this NPC, our DM will probably have her betray us, but she might be turned around...",1

DnD,REmixer56,2,"Burn down a town to save a criminal? You son of bitch I'm in! So my dungeons and dragons group decided to rescue their warlock friend before he was executed. Now why was he being executed? For the attempted rape of a noble woman and murder of a few guards before he was captured. This post however, is more so focused on the rescue attempt. 

The execution is set in the public square and flyers are handed out to explaining the place and time. This is to be a public lesson about how adventurers are not above the law and evil will be dealt with swiftly. Me planning ahead just encase the party planned to rescue the warlock had the mayor of the city order the party to be outside the city on the day of the execution. Under no circumstances were they to return until the execution was over or they would be arrested and dealt the same punishment. Harsh yes, but this had to be treated with severity. At this point I offered the group time to talk IRL so we could make a new character sheet for the warlock. Before I could print post a new sheet other three party members told me to wait as they discussed whether their characters would rescue him or not. EVentually it was decided they would make the attempt because they loved the group dynamic and their characters agree with punishing the noble woman but disagreed on the methods used. This was probably more of an IRL decision on their part, but I allowed them to do as they pleased. The next hour, I think, was spent planning. I had to make the rescue deadly and difficult in and out of combat while they came up with a plan. 

Context: In the town square hundreds of people had gathered to watch the execution. They would be using a guillotine to perform the dead on top of a wooden platform. The warlock had been badly beaten at this point for obvious reasons. He was bound, gagged, deafened and blinded with a mask since he was imprisoned. His patron had abandoned him at this point so there really wasn't a need. No weapons are allowed in the area of the execution. People have been searched. 

As the warlock is lead to the platform he had none of his gear and is merely in loose fitting pants and a shirt. At this point the druid has used wild shape to turn herself into a spider, pass some stealth checks and is riding on the clothes of people to get to the execution. After poor rolls to figure out where she was going she gets their as the warlock is being moved onto the platform. People have begun to throw rocks and boo him. The druid gets to the platform and hides herself on the warlock's pant leg. 

At this point the fighter and barbarian are late and in trouble. They were suppose to secure Horses for the group and interrupt the exectution by throwing alchemist fire, threats of violence and taking a few people hostage. They wanted to get this done with as little blood spilt as possible because before this they had generally done a number of good deeds and enjoyed the town. But here's what actually happened. Needing a method to re-enter the town they waited on the road like bandits, captured a horse drawn cart carrying hunted animals and intimidated the driver to do as they say. While keeping a knife pressed to his back the duo entered the town, told the driver to pull down the most secluded street an told him to keep his mouth shut after they exited the cart. The driver left and immediatly told some gaurds about the men who held him at knife point. What follows is a chase seen as the fighter and barbarian are running through homes and buildings trying to keep the guards from seeing their faces. They get about two houses down from the execution when they decide to break into a house and fight the ever growing amount of guards. After they non lethally drop two guards, I roll percentile to see if anyone is left in the house. They find an old woman sitting up in bed about to have some soup. Que intimidation check with fighter helping. 

Barbarian: We have an old woman who's eating soup. Stay back or we'll throw the hot soup at you

Fighter: What he means is, stay back or we'll kill the old woman. 

The warlock is now about to be loaded into the guillotine. Druid decides she can't wait any longer and shifts out of her spider form. Casting thunderwave all the guards are damaged and pushed off the platform along with the guillotine. She quickly takes off the warlock's mask and says they need magic. This is where she finds out that the warlock can no longer cast spells. Initiative is rolled, warlock cries about being in pain, guards get up and walk up platform, druid casts HEALING SPIRIT and prepares for a fight.  The warlock grabs a dagger from the druid and goes back to back with her as he takes the dodge action. Warlock has disadvantage on attacks so it isn't looking good even though he is slowly gaining health. Guards move in, land an attack on the warlock and start motioning to restrain him. Finally they say to hell with it, druid shifts into a giant goat, warlock hops onto her back and they do their best to push people aside or threaten them into moving as they get off the platform. The leader of the city steps up and monologues how they are truly disappointments to their legacy. He explains how the town will not remember what they have done for them, how their names will be dragged through the mud and that he will personally send their wanted posters out to every town and ki..... Arrow flies through the air landing in his chest. Nat 20 as the fighter and barbarian stand at the edge of the crowd with the barbarian putting an old woman in a choke hold. The guards were in an arc around them put didn't dare get closer. The towns people begin to grow angry and are getting closer to each group. My players are pleading with me IRL not to have the people attack but I'm dying from laughter as the situation is getting worse and worse. There they are surround with guards on one side and angry towns people on the other. The warlock IC tries to get the party to just hand him over but they know there's no walking away from this. 

A wreckles decision is made as they barrel through some guards and people and duck into a building. HEALING SPIRIT is gone and the party is getting low on health. That's when they decide to hit the nuclear option. Previously in our campaign they ran through a mini dungeon since they were hired to take care of a few Gnolls. During that time they found a wizard who had met his end to poison gas. On him they found a scroll of Fireball. .I had meant for it to be used latter when I threw something big at them but I suppose this counted. With the couple of alchemist fire flasks in their bag they began setting houses on fire and cast fireball right in the middle of the guards and townsfolk chasing them. The town began to burn and they slipped away after fighting and killing the guards watching the gate.

I really enjoyed this session and just wanted to share a bit of it. Things are gonna be crazy as the party is now wanted, considered evil since they killed innocent people and helped a criminal escape and THEY STILL WANT TO DO GOOD DEEDS across the land.",1

So I just watched (animated Dungeon) Scarier Zombies in D&amp;D 5e, and I love the idea of zombies being a threat and able to legit destroy the party if handled incorrectly, I have it set up where the party will probably reach this area around level 3 and I‚Äôll even give them a cleric npc to help. 

Zombie adjustments: Hp is 1, spawn 1d4 zombies for each loud noise, dc 10 con/dex save or become infected. Infected creatures lose 1 hp every day, if they drop to 0 hp while infected they instantly rise as a zombie.

They can cut there limbs off to stop the infection, or get a greater restoration spell.
I‚Äôve set up solutions for both of these situations.

My concern is that this might be too much for a level 3 party of 5 players (plus an npc which is the only healer) do any more experienced dms have any advice on how to handle this?",1

DnD,sicsche,28,"I don't like the Armor System of DnD Maybe it's just me but i don't like how DnD handles Armor.

First of all let us compare the 3 different Armor Classes, without magic items, no feats and no shield. Light Armor (BIS Studded Leather 12 + 5 Dex) is 17 AC. Medium Armor (Half Plate 15 + 2 Dex) is 17 AC. Heavy Armor (Plate 18) is 18 AC.

So basically except the most expensive Plate all those different classes make no big difference at the end of the day.  Leading to my first problem with the system. Why having 3 different Armor Classes when they end up at the same level end of the day. Shouldn't it be more like - for example - Light giving up to 15 AC, Medium giving up to 17 AC and Heavy giving up to 19 AC?

Looking at the possible feats this doesn't do too much as well. Heavy Armor Master gains 3 Damage Mitigation from non-magical Damage. Medium Armor Master could get +3 Dex Bonus and therefor match the 18 AC from Plate.

My next problem is Medium Armor in general, the limiting of Dex bonus compared (although as you can guess i am no friend of this at all) feels like forcing you to make sacrifices without benefits compared to Light Armor.

Why not scratch the Dex Bonus completely? If you would compare the different armors then it would make much more sense in comparison. The best Light Armor would match the worst Medium Armor (Studded Leather and Hide with 12 AC), the best Medium Armor would fit between the 2 worst Heavy Armor (Half Plate 15 AC vs Ring Mail 14 AC and Chain Mail 16 AC).

I know there is an argument about ""but higher Dex means you evade the hit"", well yeah. But Armor means to me there is a certain threshold before a hit can damage me, evading a hit is for me something completely different. Think about Monk unarmored defense, it makes sense. He uses his agility and ""perception"" (wisdom) to Evade getting hit when using no armor.

Am i really the only one seeing it this way? Do i simply don't get something that would give me the whole ahhhh that makes sense?",1

DnD,-Top_Water-,10,"Simple Questions from a Noob (Beast Master) So, I just started playing DnD a couple months ago with a group of friends. None of use had played previously, so we had a ""friend of a friend"" DM for the first while to teach us the ropes. Long story short, we're all fairly intelligent people and picked it up pretty quickly, but some of the finer details still evade me. I'm sure I'll throw several questions up here over time, but I'll start with a simple one. 

I'm a Ranger approaching lvl 3, and yes, I want to be a Beast Master. Since DM likely won't allow me to choose a pteranadon in this campaign, I'm leaning towards panther. Question: Max HP is listed as 13 (3d8), does this mean I have the option to roll for HP? It's the 3d8 that's making me think this.

Like a metal net that I/another character throws on an enemy and then I heat, or shooting crossbow bolts into an enemy and then heating the bolts stuck into them.

Maybe gaining immunity to fire for my character and using it as a defensive maneuvre to protect again non fire imune enemies?

Or maybe I could even shape metal like a metal bender (is that a thing in dnd? if not WTF?!) And basically wrap people in glowing hot metal.

DnD,ufailowell,5,"A document to speed up combat rolls The point of the table is to do all the rolls (initiative, hit and attack) with a click of some buttons. All you have to do is put in stats for your monsters (or players), the stat they use for attacks (Str, Dex, Wis, etc.), and if their attack modifier gets added for each attack or just once (2 or 1 respectfully in the ""x Times"" column). All the rolls and calculations can be done from their by pushing the appropriate labeled button and it should hopefully save time from rolling tons of dice. I made it for my DM and I figured I would share it with the community. Hopefully people like it! 

You need to allow the code to work on your google account for the buttons to work so I put it down below to verify there is no malice in the code. Honestly I am not much of a coder and haven't used Java before this (I was really hoping the language worked more like VBA but whatever) so if there's better ways to fix up the code I would appreciate any input!

DnD,DrunkShroom,5,[5th edition] I got bored so I did the math to find out what luck it would take to roll a perfect barbarian (since they have the highest hit die) So we start out with our 6 skills we have to roll 18 with. So that would be a (1/6)^3 or 1/216 to roll three 6s. Next we have to fo that for every other stat so now we have to roll the 1/216 chance 6 times. This would mean the chance to roll a perfect 18 skilled player would be a (1/216)^6 or 1/101559956668416 chance. That's not all though. We have to get the chance that you roll a 12 on all your level ups for hp. To do this we need to do (1/12)^19. This would be about 1/(3.19479999√ó10^20) (I would be more detailed with the number but my calculator only shows that) All we have to do now is multiply this by the 101559956668416. When we do this we get 1/(3.24463749√ó10^34). I'm going to try putting this in perspective by comparing it to the mega millions which is 1/302600000. This means it's more likely to win the mega 4 times in a row than you are to roll a perfect barbarian.

When I described the scene from afar, one player became very excited about harvesting some of the flame to make a diy continually burning torch. 

My question is - what would the mechanics of the flame be? Is it an enchanted object or an arcane construct? It says that dispel magic will extinguish the flame so I don't think it comes from an enchanted object.

DnD,ExistentialOcto,44,"PSA: ""horde"" and ""hoard"" are two different things Despite sounding the same, they mean two very different things and show up a lot in D&amp;D-related media. 

A ""hoard"" is a  ""supply or accumulation that is hidden or carefully guarded for preservation, future use, etc.: *a vast hoard of silver.""* 

A ""horde"" is  ""a large group, multitude, number, etc.; a mass or crowd: *a horde of tourists.""* OR ""a moving pack or swarm of animals: *A horde of mosquitoes invaded the camp.""*

If I'm an adventurer and I open a chest to find a **hoard**, I'll be jumping for joy.

If I'm an adventurer and I open a chest to find a **horde**, I'll be running for my life.

&amp;#x200B;

But how to remember the difference?  I'm honestly not sure. The best I can come up with is that a ""horde"" may be led by a ""lord"". Lord and horde have more in common than lord and hoard, so maybe that works? And a ""boar"" might ""hoard"" food under floor""boards""? I dunno if that helps.

DnD,admiralbenbo4782,44,"Opinion: ""Clever"" wording does not matter, only intent does. Players often want to get ""clever"" about wording things like *suggestion*, *wish*, or the triggers for Readying an action (5e). They think that by trying to be ultra-specific or ""legalistic"" in their wording, they can ensure that exactly what they want to happen will happen, even bypassing other rules. This is also true of social situations. Players try to exactly word what their characters say.

It doesn't work. The words don't matter particularly. Because the words themselves aren't being applied to the fiction-layer--they're being translated into actions, events, words in the fictional language, body language, etc inside the fictional universe (by the DM). And any such conversion is inherently lossy.

Instead, DMs should (IMO) try to implement the *intent* of the statement, in accordance with the rules. And if intent is unclear, *clarify*. Use your words. So it doesn't matter how you phrase it exactly. Your intent (and the general framework of the rules) matters 100%.

What does this mean in particular?

* Spells like *suggestion* work on intent, not wording. So small differences in wording aren't material  (but you can't lawyer someone into doing something that would have been unreasonable stated differently).
* *Wish* should be run by checking if there is a ""safe"" use first (5e: emulating a spell of 8th level or lower), even if they didn't say ""I want to cast &lt;spell&gt;."" No particular ""clever"" wording will help you if you do something unsafe, however. Because the DM is *required* to monkey's paw you. It's in the spell text itself, and clever wording can't bypass rules.
* 5e: Setting triggers to very particular events (when he *start*s casting, etc) doesn't buy you anything extra. Your readied action goes off after the triggering action or movement completes. Readied actions can't interrupt their triggering actions, because it doesn't say they can. Unlike *counterspell* and *shield* (for instance). In general, spells and abilities tell you what they do, and do only that. No hidden rules. If it could interrupt an action, it would say so.

The point of this is to relax some of the ""gotcha"" mentality that grows when people try to use clever wording to pull a fast one on another player (including the DM). Players and DMs should discuss the intent of the actions and execute as close to the intent as the rules and the dice allow. You can't bypass rules with wording, and you shouldn't do gotcha games with characters based on exact phrasing\[1\].

\[1\] the only exception in my mind is when you're explicitly working on a word-based trap or puzzle. And even then, you should ignore things until they signal that they're trying to solve the puzzle. Basically pull a ""is that your final answer"" card. Personally, I'm not fond of those types of puzzles anyway, due to the whole translation-convention issue.",1

14 years old street urchin. Living alone on the streets. A bit of a brat. Stealing and pickpocketing to survive on the streets. When getting caught trying to persuade the person of letting the character go. ""I'm only an innocent child. It's because I'm a tiefling right."" kind of thing. This while getting a knife out with the tail if the persuasion wouldn't work. Over the years of streetlife the youngster grown very mistrusting against humans. One day the tiefling youngster runs into a party of adventurers. That looks very cool to the tiefling. The youngster joins the party for the sake of cool and getting out of the city. If there are humans in the party it takes a while to trust those because of the life on the streets.
Big plottwist for the party. The tiefling boy that joined the party is actually a tiefling girl. She disguised herself as a boy because it was easier to live on the streets. Depending on the situation we run into this big reveal will be early or later in the game.

Now the backstory feels still a bit incomplete. Any suggestions I can add on?

So. Due to me last post being VERY popular (thank you all, it is really humbling), I decided to post some other images. I also included the original one.

TLDR: Thanks! And here is some backstory!

The ship is the property of the Kraken called Priszt, who had his Warlock in command of the ship. That warlock was named Viktor Manush. He was a half orc Warlock, with the Pact of the kraken, that as a favor to an enemy of the party tried to kill them. By first letting their tiny ship be attacked by some Kuo-Ton and an Aboleth, then dropping a storm on them, and finally swallowing their ship with his own, as it came from below the waves, he thought he was succesful. However, they fought their way up and managed to barely defeat him on the upper deck. 

The party's warlock changed pacts immediately, having been whispered to bij Priszt about great rewards and not being very glad with his current pact with Dispater. He now owns the ship and has access to its underwater capacities, its crew (the part that didn't die), and the teleportation circle that connects to the Kraken's network of shrines dedicated to him all across the world.

I  have been asked if I can share the blueprints, so to say. For laser cutting, for 3D printing, for simply cutting out of paper. It is a bit overwhelming. It has also been suggested that I should ask money for the files on the DMguild, or other platforms. That sounds cool!

**Upper left:**

The one with the beard is a changeling rogue who originally came from feys. He swapped place with the one without beard when they were newborns so the one without beard had an upbringing among the elves and fey creatures  (and that player is a human fighter). The changeling had the upbringing the human was supposed to have. The players are currently on ""good"" terms with each other since they both isn't very liked by one of the fey-dukes.

**Upper middle:**

A warforged warlock (fiend, pact of the chain). Has no memories from its former life. Its soul was sold to one of the evil gods and it became a construct. It fled from the demon cult and trying to figure out who it is and get its body back. Kind of like full metal alchemist but with the soul sold to the devil instead of in the armor. 

**Upper** **right:** 

High elf arcane cleric who wants to prove himself as the true heir to a powerful sword that's missing (yes, kind of like King Arthur). The player has said that he will go around and booming blade all the enemies, thereof the caption on the picture).

**Lower**

Me. A moon druid who grew up with her adoptive sister with their adoptive father and guardian. When the father dies he left them with a letter that contains clues to their true past. My druids sister also has magic but she can't control it which led to her locking herself up never going out (like Elsa from Frozen). My druid think that her sisters origin might be able to help her overcoming her fears so is setting out to find out about her sisters family. And also, find out about her own origin and real family.

The issue with this player and how I know he is lying about what his dice rolled is his unnatural ability to get a nat 20 on all of his called shots  


For those who don't know our called shot system basically is you can aim at something in particular or attempt to do something with an attack and on a nat 20 that thing will happen (within reason)  
All good and a mechanic that isn't abused in my game people use it fairly sparingly. But that is where the issue came up  


This player in our 3 sessions has made a total of 3 called shots, and not like succeeded 3 but attempted 20. They have succeeded 3 and attempted 3. Meaning they got a nat 20 every single time that they have called their shot.  


Not to mention the regular sus stuff like rolling 8 nat 20s in one night but only rolling 1 nat 1.  
Statistically possible, but extremely unlikely.  


After talking it through with some people on various discords I arrived at asking the person to weight check their dice and/or use another set next time. But I wanted to ask to see how you would deal with a situation like this, also assuming this person is someone you know IRL, not a close friend, but a friend.",1
DnD,supernobodyhome,17,"Why would allowing unarmed strikes to be used with class features be an issue? I‚Äôve been a fan of DnD for a while and read a ton of material, but I‚Äôve only been a part of a few games. Recently I seen the whole discussion of unarmed strikes and smite come up on a post from another sub, it reminded me of an attempt at making a feat to let them work with class features, and I just really wanna understand why it would be a bad thing in a lot of people‚Äôs eyes, balance wise or anything, to have some kind of feat to allow that.

I just really like the idea of unarmed being a primary option for characters willing to spec into it, regardless of class, and wanna hear the arguments against that.",1

I kind of want his backstory to pertain to the fact he became an alchemist and maybe has formed his main personality giving him the name Tryx, I figured he was a bit of a trickster, maybe multiclassing eventually into a rogue arcane trickster.

Tryx also solely uses a sling so he can maybe sling his alchemical flasks further (DM discretion ofc, hasn't been confirmed yet) 

He obv uses fire and acid however my 3rd choice is the smoke stick.

I've brainstormed many ideas, Goblin camp being destroyed by Orcs, or he's captured and develops stockholm syndrome with one of his captures who then dies later. ü§î XD idek, I feel like goblins is a bit harder than other races.

One last point, I want him to be a kinder goblin than your average goblin, maybe friendlier with other races, but of course it'll be hard to trust him. I was thinking of between Chaotic Good/Neutral.

DnD,mine1UPSyours,5,"Javelin Of Lightning regular damage; 1d6 or 1d6+4d6?? So since the javelin is not lightning when it hits the target (it transforms back) does that mean that the last 2 sentences in RAW is regardless of saying the magic word? 

As in is it always 1d6 ranged damage and 4d6 lightning damage to the intended target on a successful hit?

or

is it always 1d6 ranged damage on hit?

(yes, I understand that the creatures in-between the target and me only get hit when it transforms into lightning, but does it always do 4d6 lightning damage to the intended target?)

Rule As Written

This Javelin is a Magic Weapon. When you hurl it and speak its Command Word (Penelope),  it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that  extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the  line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The Lightning Bolt turns back into a Javelin when it reaches the target. **Make a ranged weapon Attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the Javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.** 

I am a warlock with Pact of the Blade and would use my action every other round to recall such an amazing weapon if it always does lightning damage to the target, otherwise I will just keep my staff that adds +2 to my spells damage roll and +2 to my spells attack roll as my Pact of the Blade weapon.",1

Loudener - cone that is replaces the barrel of the gun. It amplifies the sound of the gunshot from any handheld gun, but results in a -3 penalty to hit. The sound shoots out in a 15 foot cone requiring a Con save equal to the maximum damage of the gun for a single non-critical shot. example: a simple pistol according to [the Wiki](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_Renaissance_Weapons) deals 1d10 piercing damage. A lv 3 character has a proficiency bonus of +2 and lets say a dex modifier of +3. Therefore the save would be DC 10+2+3=15

On a failure, any creatures or non-magical item within takes 2d4 thunder damage, are temporarily deafened, and have disadvantage on all attack rolls, spell attack rolls, saving throws, and must roll a concentration check before casting a spell that does not require a spell attack roll. If the concentration check is failed, the spell fizzles and the slot is wasted.

On a success, the thunder damage is halved and none of the other effects apply.

Should this make the gun magical?

# Way of Suffering

Monks of the Way of Suffering are seen as the mad-men amongst the Monastic orders. They seek awakening through suffering, and the extent of that suffering is not limited to self flagellation, harm and poising. That being said, these Monks are far from cruel and understand that ki is simply the ability to suffer, a trait that binds all creatures together. Their goal is to ascend from suffering and to share that realization.

As such, these monks are actively encouraged to leave their monasteries and institutions, to walk the earth and practice their teachings first hand. Sharing their discipline, and transforming anguish into serenity. This is their expression of enlightenment.

**Instruments of Suffering**

Your careful practices in the study of self-harm have allowed you to cultivate wisdom in these arts.

You have proficiency in the medicine skill, along with the herbalism kit and poisoner's kit.

You also have an item of personal value that can inflict 1d4 damage on yourself. Using this tool to inflict harm on anyone else but the holder is inefficient and will incur disadvantage for attack rolls.

**Karmic Shift**

Beginning at 3rd level you have the ability to allocate your own well-being to those around you.

As an action, and expending 1 ki, you can touch another creature, magically transferring the remaining duration of one disease or condition afflicting it to yourself. You can ignore immunities you have to that condition. You have advantage on any new saving throws against it.

After making a successful save against the disease or condition you recieve 1d6 + Wisdom Modifier health points for each turn suffering. That health is split between yourself and your original target, odd numbers are split to favor the target.

**Clarity from Suffering**

Beginning at 6th level you have the ability to inflict pain to endow momentary clarity on a creature.

As an action you may inflict 1d4 damage to a creature within 5ft (including yourself) with your Instrument of Suffering.

The creature may spend their reaction to receive advantage for 1 skill check, attack or saving throw.

If the creature eschews or does not use Clarity from Suffering during their turn, the status ends.

**Karmic Projection**

Beginning at 11th level you have the ability to share your anguish to those surrounding you.

As an action, and expending 2 ki, a creature within 10ft from yourself must make a save DC 8 + proficiency + Wisdom Modifier, or suffer from a single disease or condition that currently ails yourself. Karmic Projection will ignore any immunities and resistances.

The target had disadvantage to save against their disease of condition. You have advantage making a saving throw against the projected disease or condition, but may forego making an attempt to make a saving throw.

When either creature succeeds on their saving throw, the disease or condition ceases for both.

**Transformed Suffering**

Beginning at 17th level you have achieved self-awakening through ruthless practice and meditation.

Both Karmic Shift and Karmic Projection no longer require touch to activate. At 20ft you are able to utilize both these features.

You also gain the ability to forcefully end a single disease or status condition at 20ft once per short rest.",1

DnD,DanRobotMan,0,"Magic Item: The Heroes' Hookah Hello All, first time posting on this sub so forgive me if this is the wrong place to post and also apologies if this item isn't actually original I didn't see anything like it.

I am working on a campaign set in the sword coast for myself and my friends to play after the lock down in the US is over. Which has given me lots of time to work on the campaign and ponder ideas for magic items for my party. Specifically I've been considering doing Vestiges akin to those in [EGtWM](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw).

This wouldn't be one of those vestiges, but an tertiary legendary magic item that I wanted some feedback on.

As the title indicates and one may surmise; The Heroes' Hookah is a magic Hookah for our Bard, which may be used to gain some of the benefits of a [Heroes' Feast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/heroes-feast).

Item Text:

The Heroes' Hookah

Once per day during a rest the magic Hookah may be packed and smoked to gain the advantages of a Heroes' Feast. With the following caveats: The affects of only last for 2 hours. The Hookah may only be passed around to up to 6 characters. Members using the Hookah must spend 30 mins during a rest using the Hookah to gain the effects.

Flavor text: Using the Hookah a purple smoke smelling of lavender and honey fills your lungs and nose. The comfort of home and a the warm embrace of your favorite lounge chair next to the coziest of fires overtakes you. Beginning with a tingle behind the ears which persists until the effect ends, which is noted with an abrupt snap in the tingling area.

The main reason for the post is for advice on tweaking the item, rarity, and potential components consumed.

I only have thoughts on potential components consumed. I was thinking some spiced tobacco which is difficult to find and costs 250 gp to obtain enough to use the item. Was also thinking about bundling the item with a pouch containing enough for 2 uses of the item.

Any thoughts or advise would be excellent!

DnD,HK_NarutoCJ,18,"Wizards Copying Spell Scrolls? So in my campaign I have recently ended the last session with my party's wizard asking about copying spells from ***Spell Scrolls***. I understand the difference between an actual Magical Item ***Spell Scroll***, and a spell being written down on a scroll, and I also am aware of the difference when it comes to their uses. 

The ***Spell Scroll***  description in the **DMG** states that a Wizard who wants to copy the spell must succeed on a DC 10 + the spell's level Intelligence (Arcana) check. Whether it is a success or failure the ***Spell Scroll*** is destroyed, if succeeded however, the spell is successfully copied.

My question is based after the wizard succeeds this check. If it is successfully copied, does that mean that they instantaneously have it copied into their Spell Book, or would this mean that it is now just available to be copied down (using the normal cost and time rules for wizards copying spells)?",1

DnD,davros333,2,"Homebrew Sniper Rifle for Artificer Looking for thoughts and constructive criticisms on this weapon, made for 5e in a Wildemount or slightly more advanced setting

Sniper rifle - has reload property so single shot per turn, specialty ammunition I have to make myself, range of 300/1200 feet, plus something to hit (3-7 if I can build a scope out of a small telescope), 4d8 piercing damage, disadvantage if I move on the same turn as firing, as well as disadvantage on targets within 10 feet, not just in melee.

A natural 20 pierces the target hitting whoever is behind them for non-critical damage. In addition, the target of the attack has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and concentration checks until the end of its next turn as it is reeling from being blasted. This also forces a DC 15 concentration check prior to casting a spell that does not require a spell attack roll. On a failure, the spell fizzles and the slot is wasted

A natural 1 misfires the gun causing it to jam and require a DC 15 Dex check to unjam. After 3 misfires the barrel will need to be replaced. Has the loud property and is just that when it fires. Big bang.

Specialty Ammunition - probably pretty costly to make, like 50 gold per bullet of material, can make 3 and hour if I have access to a smithy or forge of some sort and a full workbench to work at, maybe a DC 10 tinker's tools check per bullet to see if I mess up and waste the materials (nat 1 misfires take care of faulty ammo aspect). Making it on the road will be extremely hard, maybe a DC 25 tinker's tools check to make one in the entire evening and will require 50% more material as more will be wasted. Each individual bullet can be enchanted with elemental damage or a base +1+2+3 enchantment. Due to the small size these enchantments can be purchased at half price and take half the time

Sniper riffle barrel - custom made with intricate rifling and scope mount, requires access to a forge/smithy, takes 8 hours to make, needs to be made of high quality steel, likely requires the aid of a gunsmith and a high DC 20 tinker's tools check or you have to start over. Maybe two separate DC 15 checks, one for the barrel casting and one for the rifling, each take 4 hours so if you mess up the first stage, you can still complete a barrel if you work for 12 full hours and buy the gunsmith helping you lunch and a drink after",1
DnD,AwekwardBadass,11,"Changing gold value - is it a terrible idea? The last game I DM'd silver and copper pieces nearly had no value or use what so ever, and I think they should be.

My solution to this was going to be changing the value of money to 100 cp = 1 sp, 100 sp = 1 gp, and 100 gp = 1 pp. I also was going to start the party from more humble beginnings (no starting gold), not to screw the party out of there starting wealth but rather to give a more ""rags to riches"" feel as the party progresses. Obviously a lot of items prices will have to be tweaked in order to accommodate the change in money value. 

Is this a bad idea? If so what can I do to make it a good idea? Or what are everyone's suggestions/warnings to trying this?",1

DnD,Deppt77,9,"DMPC done right, or wrong? So, I'm a DM of about 1 year now, and I'm running a homebrew campaign's epilogue. During this campaign, my party went to a city for a festival, in their honor. At the festival, the party met the mayor of the town and, to give my bard a little fun, his two daughters, Mano and Chela. Of course, he expressed great interest in both.

Mano was a fighter and Chela, a sorcerer. The bard and the party's fighter decided to head to their quarters the next morning to give some lessons to the girls on their respective craft. Mano dueled the fighter, Bjorn, but our bard couldnt score with Chela.

Once Bjorn decided to be a father figure to Mano instead of a one night stand, they went their separate ways. The bard decided to get it on with a girl behind the tavern.

Whilst the bard did that, the town was attacked by orcs. The party + Mano and Chela teamed up to defend the town. Long story short, the bard was the only healer and Chela died at the hands of the orcs, and the rest of the town burned down. Fortunately, our brave Dragonborn Barbarian rushed back into the city to kill the rest of the orcs after a Nat 20 on a death save.

With 1 hit point, a Wand of Fire (similar to a Wand of Fireballs, but weaker), and some rage, the barbarian killed the remaining orcs and saved some of the townsfolk.

So, without a home nor family, Mano found herself mourning her father and sister (despite the fact that her father neglected her to focus on her sister, who was apparently just better at everything). The party took her under their wing and she went with them.

Over the next few sessions, the party came back to their castle (abandoned) and left Mano with the reincarnated Elf Queen (another long story) to help with her newfound depression. A few sessions later, and she was just mentally stable enough to go out on a mini adventure with them.

For the longest time, Mano was a depresso espresso but still a good fighter. The party cared for her wellbeing, but she was always modest and shy. 

Around Christmas, 2019, I ran a session that included Krampus kidnapping the party and an escape dungeon ensued. One dungeon and one portal later, they were back home and Santa, an Archfey, came to apologize and give them their christmas wish. The bard got a new instrument, the dragonborn barbarian got some wings, the fighter got a new sword, but Mano asked for her family back. 

Santa laughed and told her that she didnt want them back. Instead, he gave her what she really wanted but didnt want to admit: The ability to not feel bad whenever she was thankful she no longer had to deal with their shit. She was really happy, and the party was happy for her.

Throughout the campaign, she grew with the party like any other member. She leveled up, she fought, she got cool magic items (but not at my choice; the party gave them to her), and was accepted as a full person.

I played her like a good PC. They loved her. I loved her, but not too much so as to bend the game to her favor. The only favor I gave her was a 20 in Strength when they first found her, as a part of her training to please her father. I even used her as a plot device once (evil guy tricked her into giving him a Ring of Wish, which she immediately felt bad for, and the party couldn't have the ring. They asked their Goddess Patron to destroy it, and she did, for a price).

The damndest thing is that one of the characters actually fell in love with Mano. They plan to marry once the Epilogue (known better as The Adventures of the Broke-ass heroes) finishes. I never asked this of the player. Nothing Mano has today was special treatment on my part, but the party respect her as a powerhouse (which any 15th level fighter is) and love her as a friend.

TL;DR The party brought a sad, improved NPC along with them who they grew to love and respect as an equal. She got cool magic items and normal character stuff, but I didn't give it to her, the party did.

Is this a good or bad DMPC? Many people despise DMPCs, but is this one acceptable?",1
DnD,Arkaingate,9,"Today I killed players. Long, im sorry, im sad. So, long story short I guess, I have 5 players.  One comes and goes as he has a busy life, ones my wife whos always super kind in game to people but also usually moderately annoying yet lovable characters (kobold bard....) and she loves to role play.  I have three others, Q is a best friend and close with W and E.  Now W/E are new and started playing in my last campaign like a year ago that didnt end well as I was learning as a DM, and Q tried to kill a player and got killed by another player because they disagreed on something small.  

So we restarted the campaign, I made a new story, I flushed the shit out of this world and the story and what they do, i spend hours every week planning and getting stuff ready.  Q here *I would say treats the game like a video game.*   He will do what benefits him as he believes he has plot armor, and even after talking to him multiple times, continues to do it.  Throw him in jail? no worries, people will break him out or he will pay his way.  Guards questioning him in a tavern? fuck it, lets spit on them.  He's a cleric that literally values money and selfishness over anything else.  And I kept warning him and asking why he role plays a certain way (again, like a video gamer, imo, as games dont truly have consequences)

Anyway -- Today it happened.  I had made a really atmospheric place, theyre about 14 sessions into this campaign or so and it has a great story and feel and liveliness to it as all my players have loved this campaign and all the events, from racing in wagons to battles, traps, characters that persist, storylines that lead you along but dont force you.  I've felt great about this campaign.

I put a goblin outside of their little tent, eating the corpse of a drow they killed.  The goblin (the night before they heard him, saw the golem, but didnt see the goblin) has the power to control a huge earth elemental, and finally at last mastered it and got it to work after many, many tries.  The goblin, in his stupidity, was taking the elemental to attack the drow, but stopped along the way as he saw some nice fresh meat.

1 player squishes him and he passes out from lack of oxygen after he threw his wand to wake up his 'MIGHTY ROCK STEED' and yelling to let him go.  Eventually, he wakes up (and my wife attacking 1 player with the back side of her spear as she was like oh he jus a cute boi).  He draws dagger and is like 'YALL ARE DANGEROUS' and runs -- only to be shot by Q instantly with his biggest spell, which the rock elemental saw and went after Q.

Anyway, Q died.  E died trying to save Q.  Goblin offered (after being given potions, healing, and woken up) to stop his elemental if they got him his wand so he could and wanted Q's hand for trying to murder him.

Q died.  Q blamed me and got upset that I didnt listen to his intimidates before he shot him (Which he eldrich blasted the face of another kid at the start of the session, a main c haracter, to show he has cool tricks 'but didnt want to do damage') and that *its my fault* the ele kept hitting him and wanted to kill him for (what the ele thought) was killing its master.

I feel like my time is wasted.  We spent 3 hours, the entire session, dealing with this shit and him being stubborn and not thinking about consequences.

I'm pretty upset as a DM rn because I like them all, but I cant really drop any players without dropping more, and he wont listen to conversation about roleplaying because 'thats what his character would do' and, to me, his character is a video game character with perceived plot armor.

Maybe im over-reacting and upset about killing a player, but I feel bad about hurting any players experience, but also am tired of holding back to *protect* his experience.",1
DnD,MrsBigDoor,10,"I lack creativity and leadership when playing. Help ? I'm a newbie when it comes to DnD. Playing for about a year on and off either Pathfinder or 5e. I've been playing with our family squad of 3 and my brother as  DM. Our DM is newer as well and he does really well. I typically play a support cast like a cleric or a druid but this campaign I'm the leader of the pack. I didnt sign up for it, but everyone is expecting me to perform... I lack creativity on what to do, where to go, how to cast spells ( I know what spells to use but the how I go about it, which makes the game fun). Even when RPing, I often dont have good questions so I feel like I'm floundering and bringing the group down and it's just not as much fun. 

It seems obvious to others what to do but I'm feeling clueless. I enjoy the game but dont seem to catch on like everyone else. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance.",1

DnD,ufailowell,0,"I made a Google Sheet to help speed up combat The point of the table is to do all the rolls (initiative, hit and attack) with a click of some buttons. All you have to do is put in stats for your monsters (or players), the stat they use for attacks (Str, Dex, Wis, etc.), and if their attack modifier gets added for each attack or just once (2 or 1 respectfully in the ""x Times"" column). All the rolls and calculations can be done from their by pushing the appropriate labeled button and it should hopefully save time from rolling tons of dice. I made it for my DM and I figured I would share it with the community. Hopefully people like it! 

You need to allow the code to work on your google account for the buttons to work so I put it down below to verify there is no malice in the code. Honestly I am not much of a coder and haven't used Java before this (I was really hoping the language worked more like VBA but whatever) so if there's better ways to fix up the code I would appreciate any input!

Climbed up to the second story and ended up bribing 2 guards I ran into.

So snuck into mayor's office, found LITERALLY NOTHING INCRIMINATING. AT ALL. (For a DM that was super against any and all politics it was honestly surprising)

So finding absolutely nothing... I figure I've gotta cover my tracks a bit as to why I broke in. So I slide a chair under the door. Ask the DM if there is anything valuable looking. And after picking that up... I completely trash the place. I'm talking pull everything off every shelf, knock plants over. Tip over the desk. And once the guards heard that and tried to get in? Jumped out the window, made a mad dash back across the courtyard. And on the mile hike back to my inn, walked through alleys dropping the mayor's valuables all across the city.

And never got caught. I should add this mansion was fully patrolled by guards, DM at the time just had difficulties scaling things, and hadn't had to deal with my rogue shenanigans up to this point.",1

I found myself disappointed with the lack of space-themed subclasses in the book (because let's face it, space is pretty rad), so I decided to make my own; thus, the Constellation Paladin was born! I'm still new to homebrewing in general, so any advice / ideas / adjustments are more than welcome.

**Oath of the Constellations**

While some Paladins find their solace with the pleasures of earth or the lofty ideals of truth and justice, others look even higher, to the great cosmos above. Constellation Paladins swear by the stars above to be beacons of light, meant to guide others to their calling. Sometimes affectionately referred to as the 'Knight-Lights', these warriors are proficient with a weapon to protect, but also often know the movement of the stars and the maps needed to track them.

**Tenants**

* **Guidance.** Show the way to those who are lost in the darkness of hatred or ignorance by your words or actions, as the stars have been guides for many others.
* **Steadfastness.** Just as the stars above have not stopped their glimmer since the dawn of time, neither should you sway in what you believe to be right.
* **Equality.** The stars shine upon all - as should you not pass too quick judgment before considering all options or sides that might be presented to you.

**Oath Spells**

**3rd:** Fog Cloud, Chromatic Orb  
**5th:** Moonbeam, Skywrite  
**9th:** Clairvoyance, Melf‚Äôs Minute Meteors  
**13th:** Dimensional Door, Otiluke‚Äôs Resilient Sphere  
**17th:** Dream, Wall of Light

**Channel Divinity**

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

* **Guiding Light:** A bright circle of stars surrounds your head in a constellation. When you or an ally within 30ft. make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your Channel Divinity to give a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the roll is successful or not.
* **Starburst:** As an action on your turn, you may make your weapon shine with a brilliant light, like a newborn star. Each hostile creature within 30ft. of you must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC, or be blinded for the duration. If they choose, a hostile creature affected by this may use their action on their turn to save from the effect. In addition to the damage your weapon deals, it also deals 1d8 + your Paladin level in radiant damage whenever you attack with it.

Both of these effects end after 1 minute.

**Aura of Moonlight**

Starting at 7th level, a shining, silvery aura surrounds you in 10 ft.. Any friendly creature, including yourself, who stands in the aura gains darkvision for 30ft. If the creature already has darkvision, the range is doubled. In addition, any shapechanger or invisible creatures within 10ft. of you must make a Charisma saving throw, or take 2d10 radiant damage at the start of each turn, or half if it succeeds. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

**Telescopic Clarity**

Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on Insight checks. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded or charmed.

**Nebulous Soul**

At 20th level, your body can take on the form of a glimmering, ethereal constellation. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For one minute, you gain the following effects -

* You gain resistance against all damage types
* You gain darkvision for 120 ft.
* You shed bright light for 30 ft. Any hostile creature who enters your space in the duration is blinded, and has disadvantage against spell attacks and melee attacks.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.",1

1. Is it possible to be a free-lance full time writer for DND and other rpgs? or is it the sort of thing where you really have to get employed by WOTC or similar to make a living wage?
2. I've put up some stuff, but... i guess im not comfortable really asking for money (until i know it's worth it), so prefer the patreon/pay what you want/ko.fi model - but this doesnt seem very sustainable, do you know of anyone who does make enough using this model?
3. is it fun? or does it just turn a fun hobby into work?
4. is it a saturated market? It seems like there's already more adventure material out there than one could ever use; is there anything that people wish there was more of but haven't seen?

Currently it seems like the sort of thing that you can really only do as ""a fun hobby that you maybe can make enough to buy a beer with"", which is obviously fine, but i would love to know more about the professionals.",1

As a rogue, I get the Expertise feature. It says, ""At 1st lvl, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.""

For this, I chose two skills, Sleight of Hand and Stealth. My base dexterity modifier is 2. So, 2, plus my now doubled proficiency would make that a total of 6 for those two skills.

Now, I need to pick open an iron lock box. I have proficiency with thieves' tools. It says, ""This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks. ""

So, does that give me an addition +2 bonus, making the score a total of 8 before I even roll? We're continuing with the game on the basis that it doesn't, but both of us would like to know in the event that this situation pops up again. Thank you!",1

My god it went so much better than I thought it would.....of course now almost all my players are cursed and that is just a whole new level of writing I have to get involved in.

&gt; HOT TIP: How to create NPC faces for your #ttrpg 
&gt;
&gt;1. Generate a face on [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com)
&gt;
&gt;2. Run it through [portraitai.com](https://portraitai.com)
&gt;
&gt;3. Profit

This is excellent and kind of fun too.    
(Just refresh thispersondoesnotexist to get a new face as many times as you like).

I was discussing Mind Flayers today and the subject of alhoons (a Mind Flayer Lich) came up, specifically how they are hunted by normal Mind Flayers when ever they find them.  So my question is how would a colony of Mind Flayers (base CR 8) hunt and exterminate an Mind Flayer Alhoon (base CR 18, the highest Mind Flayer CR I can quickly find)?  Would they just use numbers (wearing it down with slaves/thralls before moving in themselves), hire/coerce adventurers (possibly from an allied Drow settlement) or would the colony's Elder Brain move out to deal with the threat/abomination in their midst?

DnD,greenlab2099,9,"Character Concepts so I'm having problems coming up with a character, I have two concepts in mind but I can't choose between them. asking for advice.

concept 1: a noble paladin (race not decided) that was driven mad with power by a devil or demon (don't know the difference) that ended up killing his family in a fit of madness. once he snapped out of it and saw what he had done he fled the city to live in exile. he now wanders the land hoping to redeem himself. but the truth is, that power hungry part of him still exists. and the worst part is that, he enjoyed the power.

concept 2: a kind hearted necromancer doctor that uses their revival and control over the dead to save people on the brink of death. she is kind, generous, motherly, and does her best to save her friends and allies. (race not decided)

so the reason I'm stuck between these two is because that concept 1 is a backstory and concept I really like while concept 2 is a personality I really like. so what are your recommendations? what would you change and what would you keep?",1

DnD,MBwithaDMG,26,"Periapt of Wound Closure + 14th Level Path of the Zealot Barbarian = Nigh Unkillable Character(?) I was making a Path of the Zealot Barbarian/Way of the Open Hand Monk multiclass today, and envisioning what it would look like at 20th level (I can dream haha) when I stumbled across a potentially game-breaking combination of player character and magic item.

Below, you'll find the *Rage Beyond Death* feature:

&gt;Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.  
&gt;  
&gt;While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points. 

And below this, you'll find the description for the *Periapt of Wound Closure*

&gt;*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
&gt;  
&gt;While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.

Now, if I am interpreting this correctly, couldn't a 14th level Path of the Zealot Barbarian attuned and wearing the *Periapt of Would Closure* be only killed at 0 health by taking damage equal to their hit point maximum (which is unlikely since even with a 10 Con the Barbarian would have 103 hp if they took the flat 7 hp per level)? 

By 14th level, the Barbarian would have five rages they could keep chaining (assuming they even just smack themselves with an unarmed strike) for a minute per rage, which is fifty rounds of combat. Even at 0 hp, the rage will keep them from dying, and at the beginning of every turn, the *Periapt* should stabilize them since they're at 0 hp and capable of accumulating failed death saves, which should remove all death saves. 

Seems like a nigh unbeatable combo to me.",1
DnD,MrMarblz,9,"D&amp;d 5E, Combat Mechanics: Ready, Reaction, and Attack of Opprotunity So my friends and I are getting back into D&amp;D. Some of us old, some new. During our first session we had a debate about the above titled systems.

I'll try to keep this neutral for each interpretation.

One perspective is that an Opportunity of Attack is basically a specific Reaction. But if they wanted to do something other than an attack they could specify the condition and the Reaction.
For example, a player could make their basic attack, then use their free action to pull out a net, and say ""if X creature gets within range I throw the net on it as my Reaction"".
However, if it's a spell they would need to cast it as their main action and use concentration to hold it until it triggers the Reaction unless it specifically states Reaction, like the spell Shield.
Using Ready as the player's main action is more for spells during combat (as just described) or before initiative is rolled to avoid getting surprised. For example, ""while that player slowly opens the door I stand next to it with my sword, Ready. So if a creature comes in I attack it.""

The second perspective is that in order to do anything other than the standard Opportunity of Attack as a Reaction the player cannot attack on their main action. The player is required to use Ready as their main action. This means that Ready and Reaction is a two part process, and that Attack of Opportunity is the only type of Reaction that does not require using Ready as a player's main action and is not a two part process.
So, back to the first example. A player must use Ready as their main action if they wanted to throw a net on X creature if it gets within range. This would be instead of using an Attack of Opportunity.
So the player can either potentially get two attacks, one during their main action and one during an Attack of Opportunity. Or the player can essentially wait for the opportunity to throw their net, but not make an attack on during their main action.

So which is correct?",1

DnD,ShadowAtiriya,13,"Update on I might have a dnd problem: It got worse I'm so sorry if this shows up twice, Reddit said it was removed when I first posted it, so I've gone back and edited it cause I got too steamed/upset and swore the first time so that's gone.

Gods. I'm still messed up over this so I might not be very clear but, I'm trying. 

If you want the full story, go [here for my first post and come back when you've read it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/gmhv69/i_might_have_a_dnd_problem/) But, I'll get into this as fast as I can.

But. Last session was yesterday, won't be playing for six weeks after this cause dm has irl things, but. Dm purposefully killed all of us but two of us with a dragon WE HAD BEEN *WINNING* AGAINST DESPITE HIM STATING HE STACKED THE ODDS IN HIS FAVOR and two of us not dying automatically was that was because Mask's character was able to use an ability of hers to shield my druid after it worked with hers. My main character my monk, Mage's Sorcerer, and Dark's fighter went down as well as two of the NPCs with us, he *didn't even let us do death saves.*

He was taunting us all for no apparent reason(""well I won't need to dm this group anymore"" ""Good thing everyone has secondary characters"", ""THey're JUST characters"", etc) as we were clearly upset and *I actually left the room. I threw my headphones onto my laptop, got up and left the room which was very clear to hear.* I was in NEAR TEARS, enough to where I had to go snuggle with one of my cats to calm down enough to come back.

And I'm pretty sure my leaving the room was THE ONLY reason he ended up stating that when the party went down the wizard character had run forward and let his magic ring explode, taking the dragon down *but also probably killing/blinding us*, and apparently an angel saved the rest of the party, so no one is actually dead, and THAT'S WHERE HE LEFT IT OFF AS A ""Cliffhanger"".

.......

He apparently did this so we could have a flashback sequence as he wants to get back to character backstories. *There are other ways for flashbacks to happen, I'm a fiction writer of at least five years, why do you think my character backstories are so involved and detailed, so I know that there are better ways to do them.*

I have an unlisted stream up of that session on my yt, as I was SO WORRIED I streamed it to three of my friends(one being the one I wanted to join the group), so I can readily show proof of this... Mess if it's needed.

I'm *so upset I can't even put it into words.*

Safe to say, he's got a major backlash coming his way when I finally calm down, from both me and Mage as we're both working on getting a few characters we want to add to the party, two being 3.5e characters. One is Mage's original character from YEARS ago who is VERY MUCH NOT A PUSHOVER, and mine is my NWN character who is very powerful at least when it comes to using some of her spells.

But he just lost our trust, and I for one will NEVER trust him again. I don't care how many characters I'll need to play so this doesn't happen again, I'm not taking a chance when he clearly only sees our characters as toys to mess with and break when they are not just characters to us.",1

DnD,Alienzexist,18,"Adding the ability to choke while grappling So I've been trying to work out a way to add choking into my campaign as I have a PC who is playing a professional wrestler barbarian essentially. I've looked at a bunch of other posts regarding the mechanics and this is the basic rules I'm going with. I have a few things I'm unsure of and was hoping to get some input on what you all think is the most fair way to include it in game. Anyone can attempt to choke with these rules, so PC's can fall victim to this as well. I will detail the rules I am unsure of at the bottom of the post

Choking rules:

Creature must be the same size or smaller and be grappled by the choker

Use your action to attempt to choke creature which is a regular contested grapple check 

On success creature starts suffocating and can't speak 

On strangled creatures turn they can attempt to break free of the choke or do any action it could do while being grappled unless it needs to speak to do so

Whenever choker takes damage another athletics contest takes place against the choked opponent

A creature can also attempt to break the choke on the target if they are within 5 feet which is a contested strength check 

If the creature is choked for a number of rounds equal to 1+con modifier the creature falls unconscious for 1d3 rounds (normally suffocating reduces hp to 0 but this seemed too OP)

After those rounds a con save is done at the end of the unconscious creatures turns or whenever the creature takes damage. Regaining consciousness on a success

The rules I am unsure about are 

1. Should a choked creature be silenced while being choked? Perhaps a con save in order to speak or use a spell with a verbal component would be better?

2. Should grapple checks for choking be done using athletics or just strength? Choking should be harder than grappling and in the later levels using athletics will add a huge advantage to the choker if they have expertise in athletics, which my wrestler PC definitely will take


Let me know if this seems like a semi-balanced system to add or if you can think of any ways to improve it",1

DnD,Neoboe,2,"The pettiest ‚Äúsibling‚Äù fight of the century. My party of 8 is pretty diverse but out of all of us there are 2 half elves, myself being one of them. Due to this we‚Äôve been dubbed siblings by our party despite this annoying our characters in game. 

As background:
My character is a youngish Ice sorcerer whose personality is essentially a sassy, ‚Äúcold‚Äù person who generally has an above it all attitude and thinks he‚Äôs more mature than he really is.

The other half elf is a tiny 17 yo Druid who gets what she wants by being cute and charming those she comes across, while secretly playing pranks on those who don‚Äôt fall for it. 

For reasons too long to explain we have a bit of a grudge towards each other and have been mouthing off at each other for a few in game days at this point. The party recently stopped at an inn and have been chilling waiting for midnight. To pass the time we start working the patrons of the bar; singing songs, playing bar games and drinking. 

The Druid gets the idea to put on a show by magically taking the water from some customers cups and making shapes and making it dart between people.

I get the idea to mess with her by also using shape water to disrupt her secretly. This happens several times before she catches on and she realizes it‚Äôs me. 
She gets mad and splashes me with someone‚Äôs beer, but the desired effect doesn‚Äôt last long since I immediately cleaned myself with prestidigitation as well as soiled her own clothes with the same cantrip. 

This really got her going so she druidcrafted a cloud to appear and storm over me. Which I blew away with prestidigitation as well. 

At this point a crowed formed around our ‚Äúgreat magic battle‚Äù and for show I misty stepped behind her and gave her a tiny shock with shocking grasp (my dm allowed it to be minimum damage since I wasn‚Äôt really trying to harm her but he did require us to roll initiative). In response she tried to hit me with a thorn whip but missed and almost hit a customer. At this point the monk of our party stepped in and put it to a stop. 

We settled down and eventually got our mission for the night started but it was an interesting experience that I‚Äôm surprised happened between two people in a party. It definitely solidified the sibling dynamic though.",1

DnD,Doveen,17,"If I understand the rules right, using a few kobolds and 6 days, you can kill a party stranded in the wilderness if they don't have any ""Shelter spells"" Such as tiny hut, rope trick, et cetera. 

The Rules say that fighting interrupts long rest. Technically, a kobold going to the camp, and lobbing a dagger at you, is fighting. That's a long rest interrupted. Now i don't know how often exactly are exhaustion points handed out, but if I got that right, you get one after every 24 hours without sleep. A long rest removes one, and prevents getting one. (If you have one exhaustion point, you won't get enother, AND one is removed.)

Which means, if you can keep interrupting long rests, which can technically be done by just one ""Suicide by cop"" kobold going up to the party and lobbing a simple rusty dagger at them, at the end of the 6th day without long rest, the 6th point of exhaustion kills them.

1. The players almost killed the main villain early which would have ended the game immediately. 
2.  I (probably over compensating due to the first issue) inadvertently killed a PC. 

For 1) I didn't want to remove the players' agency but at the same time I knew it would be no fun if they killed the villain too quickly so I gave the villain some extra actions in combat to get out of the situation. 

For 2) I changed the behavior of the spell and said players were at 1 hit point instead of 0 so that they could stay alive.

This is the second title in my series ""All about that weapon!"" where I expand on a weapon in many different ways. The spear is usually outshined by other weapons and it is rarely seen in DnD 5e games. This always seemed odd to me since it is one of the best (if not the best) weapon for more than half of humanity's history. So if you are intrested on creating a spartan-like warrior, learning new feats, equiping your character with epic magic spears or fighting an enemy Phalanx of Hoplites the time is now!

[""All about that spear!"" (The Hoplite Subclass and more)](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/314803/All-about-that-spear-The-Hoplite-Subclass-and-more?src=by_author_of_product)

Inside it you will find:

1. The Hoplite Fighter Subclass, a spartan-like warrior.
2. Four new feats featuring the spear and other thrown weapons.
3. Two brand-new weapons the longspear and the sarissa.
4. 11 new magic items including an artifact.
5. Three spear armed NPC Star blocks to help or fight your players.

If you have any intresting fact about the spear or any stories from your spear armed warrior i would be delighted to talk about them in the comments \^\_\^ !

We were ambushed by a pack of dire wolves, and when our cleric dropped, one of the wolves moved away from the paladin (taking an opportunity attack) in order to bite the cleric at 0 hp (2 failed death throws). I guess this could be coincidence since there were like 3 other wolves and only one went for the cleric.

In a later encounter, we raided a goblin camp and we lost our rogue near the end. The last goblin who was hiding in the bushes shot an arrow at our rogue at 0 hp because according to our DM, ""goblins are cowardly and target the weakest enemy.""

For our last boss fight, the boss has Blindsight and Misty Step and keeps targeting our squishy rogue, Misty Stepping away to avoid opportunity attacks. He only ever made attacks on the rogue (unless AoE spell) and continued to attack him even after he dropped to 0 hp. DM later targeting someone who's already down so they can't be healed back easily is exactly what a smart villain would do.",1

DnD,DonValhalla,36,"Unpopular opinion: Dark Sun is never coming to 5th Edition because the system is not intended for low magic. So, I've been working on trying to fit to the Dark Sun to 5th Edition, and there's a lot of problems with my adaptation:

1. Races are totally different. The elves are not forest dwelling peoples, they're nomads that take running as a way of life, this led me to get rid of subraces and had to make a new race alltogether. This is applicable to halflings and dwarves.
2. The arcane and divine systems are totally different. The thing about magic is not that its ""rare"", the way it is conceived is totally different. Magic comes from living things, and affects nature when is cast and divinity is nonexistent, this leads to the fact that Bards, Clerics, Paladins, Sorcerers, Warlocks and Wizards have to change not only their ideologies (which is what they do in worlds like Eberron) but also a lot of their mechanics. And in that note:
3. Magic is so interweaved on 5th edition that ALL classes have some kind of magic user. Imagine the notes at the start of a tentative book: in this world you can't use Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster or Shadow Monk... Which is what I had to not get into trouble with those subclasses. 
4. The Psionics are the most prevalescent power in Athas. Merchants and regular people, and also animals and even plants have mind powers. This CAN be represented, but I think goes against the ""do it clean and simple"" philosophy of 5e. Creating a whole system of defenses and combat for the use of psionics is almost impossible in 5e. To give you an idea, in 2e Psionic has its own defenses and mind combat is a thing, and to represent this you have to change a lot of things or add another system to the game. To represent this, I had to strip a lot of the mechanics and go with a more simple way, but to compensate I have to represent it in lore and descriptions. 

There's a lot of changes that I don't know if are possible with the system as it is, and a lot of times I wondered if its worth it or if it's easier to migrate to another ""low magic"" set of rules. 

In my opinion, Dark Sun is not fitting in a lot of ways with the system... But I'm still trying.",1
DnD,LordFadora,14,"Discourse Over Alignments So me and my players are arguing over alignments and how they apply to characters.

I think alignments are very simple. They‚Äôre basically how the character believes themselves to be, not what they actually are and what that character does.

A Good character can believe that what they‚Äôre doing is for the greater good, or that they‚Äôre doing the world a service or they‚Äôre actively helping people, while they are actually doing very evil things, and an Evil character can be solely out for themselves and wanting to cause harm, but actually be very bad at being a bad guy, if you know what I mean.

My players, however, think the opposite. To them, a character should actively act out their alignment. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the character believes themselves to be, or how they carry themselves. If you do evil things, your actual alignment is Evil, and they will wait for you to change it if it isn‚Äôt Evil already. If you argue, you can maybe work your way towards being Chaotic Neutral or even Neutral, but not Good.

For example, I‚Äôve played a game DMed by one of my players, and I accidentally killed a child. My guy‚Äòa a little kobold Summoner, and one of my fellow players told me to summon my giant dragon demon inside a house and torch it, since we thought an enemy was calling for reinforcements. I killed the enemy, but I also killed his kid, even though I had no idea the kid was in there. Then everyone hounded me that my guy wasn‚Äôt Neutral Good anymore, just Chaotic Neutral.

Needless to say, it stopped the game for a while until I conceded that my guy was Neutral.

I‚Äôm not asking if they were in the right to do it or not, or if my alignment concept is better. 

How do you guys handle alignments?",1

DnD,belqinor,2,"Magical Slave Contract I find myself in need of air tight rules and text body of an oath for a magic and/or devil contract. (they will need to free one of there own from it, Ill ad an exploit if it fits the story, they may just need to find and burn the contract paper)

Here are my thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Does the magic rely on the collective subconscious, or personal minds  involved to provide subjective definitions of all words in the spell? *(I.E. can re-learning on a truly deep level is possible, but very hard, as in real life)*
2. If there is a physical manifestation of the contract, is all  logic and/or wording fixed because is not subject to memory faults, or  is it in the mind of the contract holder?
3. How does the contract effect the mind? Internalizing it directly, or by another means? *(Ideas)*

* (a) placebo (any symptoms or effects as directed in the contract)
* (b) Executive dysfunction
* (c) that thing I could never find a name for, but is like this: driving to work when I meant to go home from the store
* (d) Visual or auditory delusions (any symptoms or effects the mind can produce as directed in the contract)

Here is what a rough sketch of logic that I have so far: *(based on the laws of robotics)*

       * You shall not by any act of yours harm me, or, by inaction, allow me to come to harm
         * You shall obey the orders given you by me except where such orders would conflict with clauses preceding this
         * You shall protect your own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with  clauses preceding this
          * You shall take no chances in the failure of my orders except where such orders would conflict with clauses preceding this
         * You shall if your hand is forced, take the course of lesser deviation over greater deviation of any order except where such orders would conflict with clauses preceding this 

Am I missing anything? Is there a loophole, or something incomplete or to vague?

Last but not least: what is the best way to translate this into a contract?",1

DnD,Gasolineman9,10,"[AskDnD] How much damage should I be doing? I'm currently playing my first campaign, and I'm bothered by the fact that I feel like I'm constantly doing subpar damage. My teammates are seemingly always the real hard hitters, while I just scrape by every encounter barely scratching my opponents.

This is mitigated by the fact I'm a Circle of the Shepard Druid, which means two things: 1) I'm a utility caster first and foremost. All of my ostensibly offensive spells (Shillelagh, Ice Knife, Flaming Sphere, and Call Lightning) I have used for utility rather than damage dealing at some point. Still, I think there's no reason I can't by useful both in and out of combat. 2) My primary damage output is supposed to come from animals I conjure. Despite this, I don't feel like my beasts every actually do much damage, so no matter what I'm just not very strong. Altogether, even though I know I'm not meant to be a frontline attacker or anything, I still feel weak all the time.

So what am I doing wrong? I might do, like, 15 damage on a good turn, while my opponents are hitting for upwards of 20 or 30 every single time.

DnD,TheBookOfZach,5,"Player keeps trying to get my alignment changed Hey guys, this is a weird situation that has never happened to me, and I'm curious to get your input.

This isn't my first time playing a LG Paladin, though this is my first time putting a spin on lawful good as a concept. As a young kid and later teen playing DND, I understood Lawful Good to almost always mean lawful stupid. That alignment has been the stuff of legends, with many players insisting that they're necessarily anti-fun- so I felt personally challenged to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a half-orc bastard noble who was essentially conscripted into a religion focused around two premises: protecting the realms of the living and destroying anything extraplanar. He's done some of the lawful stupid things by requirement- for instance, he's potentially laid his life against odds that seemed overwhelming for no reward. He refuses to take from those who are already impoverished, even if they insist on giving him anything.

But, he's also exercised brutality. With 20 strength and a natural, orcish penchant towards the art of 'forceful persuasion' he has often stretched what some would understand as Lawful Good if they only had one understanding of the alignment. When non-surrendering parties attempt to murder the party and that which the party is protecting, he will waste no time in doing something creative like challenging- then ripping the head off of a Hobgoblin captain if it means the rest of his pack will surrender or rout. He similarly has no problem utilizing intimidation to get what he wants- it just so happens that what he wants is true order and a plane untouched by extraplanar forces.

At the climax of the last session, we found that a quest-giver who sent us off to investigate a forbidden area related to extraplanar forces TAINTED by these forces. He had horrifying flesh mutations and used his new maw to consume the head of a slave who brought him bad news. For all of these reasons, my character had no problem issuing him a death writ and striking him down right there. The evidence was clear, and everybody in the party saw it. Apparently, though, the chaotic neutral player who has constantly been (ICly) doing things without asking anybody and compromising the party's security didn't like this. He tried to defend the quest giver from the death sentence, then, failing that, fired upon my character and ran away.

While the rest of the party seems ambivalent or on-board with my guy, CN's player yet again kicked up a furor about how my guy is too brutal and too mean to be either Lawful or Good- or, if he is lawful, he definitely is closer to evil because of his penchant for brutality. I've argued that while he's had a lust for blood, it's only been for unyielding combatants or those who truly went beyond the pale. He's said 'the law is not a barometer' but only in reference to the fact that it's not the laws on the books, but the /true/ law, the underlying principles of his order. Legal slavery is still evil, as is 'legal' baseless murder.

Also, in a metagaming sense, CN's player seems antsy that my character won't forgive his for the attempted murder since it's ""not lawful good"" but I've explained that his character has demonstrated himself to be an extraplanar-sympathetic enemy combatant- and a murderer. No forgiveness will come and any attempt to earn forgiveness will be seen as deception- this seems reasonable to me, even in a lawful good framework.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a simple question but I have found many answers and so I would like to get a consensus.

Are the children of Human/Tiefling relationships always born a Tiefling or can they be born Human?

I have read things that say children with a Tiefling parent are always Tiefling.  I have read other things that say children with one Human and one Tiefling parent has a 50/50 chance of being born either.

DnD,ThomTimm,10,"Faerie Fire in Conjuntion with Greater Invisibility I have an idea that I'm not sure if it would work or not and I am curious as to what you guys think. I had this idea to combine the spells Faerie Fire with Greater Invisibility in order to fight enemies you are not allowed to see or take ill effects from having sight of them such as a medusa or something like that. 

Now the plan I have in mind is having 2 spellcasters each cast on of these spells ideally faerie fire first then greater invisibility so that the creature's location/form is still visible but the party can't actually see the body of the creature or whatever makes looking at them a hazard. 

My reasoning: Greater Invisibility lasts for a minute and doesn't need a willing creature for it to work. It also doesn't break when casting a spell or making an attack (from my understanding). The party can't see it, no hazard, except invisimonster. Faerie Fire prevents a creature from benefiting from invisibility but doesn't say it stops the spell/ability from functioning so I would assume that it basically has the effect of throwing glitter on the creature. so you could still ""see"" them without having to see them. You would need 2 casters because both GI and FF are concentration. 

Now, the downside to this is if they move after GI is cast then you've pour gas on your housefire, and the same goes if they pass their dex save. Also, this really only works on 1 creature (2 if you have a sorcerer with twin spell), so maybe not the best thing in the world if there are multiple. It also doesn't work until you get to level 7 in order to get GI.

DnD,maxcassettes,7,"World Building: If you were playing in a setting where the monster races (goblins, bugbears, orcs, kobolds) were the dominant races, what differences would you want/expect to see? Following world changing events that ultimately spell the end for the currently established society:

 Largely due to their own actions, humans, dwarves, and elves have had their populations severely reduced by plague and war. Survivors have been driven to the fringes of society, taking up the former residences of their monstrous enemies of days past, or reclaiming the ruins of long forgotten fortresses built by their distant ancestors. Those who were able and welcome retreated even further to places like the Feywild and the ancient Dwarven keeps far beneath the mountains. 

Great cities, like Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate, are now inhabited by a mosaic of creatures, trying their best to establish a society that isn't based on bloodshed and conquest. As a result, the various ways and cultures of these people has begun to evolve, and new societal roles and norms have provided opportunities for even the most unlikely individuals to pursue art, music, science, magic and beyond. 

There does exist a small population who walk freely inside the city walls they once called their own, contributing to society in what ways they can. In the name of peace and progress, they are welcome by most - but not all. 

Aside from these folks, most interactions with the old races do end in bloodshed, as most are unwilling to accept their reduced status in this new world. Some have sought out vampiric and lycanthropic allegiances and built new bastions on the edges of the map; others have managed to maintain small communities that range from openly hostile to reluctantly, sometimes deceptively, cooperative to the new order of things. 

Meanwhile, others less fortunate have evolved into something more capable of surviving the harsh environments where they now reside. Sewer folk, swamp people, mountain clans and other primitively structured tribes - their numbers impossible to track due to their reclusive and nomadic nature. 

Necromancy, although forbidden by those who lead the new world, still runs rampant among the old races and rumors tell of entire cities beyond the Tortured Land, filled with the undead and ruled by ageless dark wizard kings. 

Furthermore, three of the Five Ships that once guarded the Northern City of Luskan in the Spine of the World were rumoured to have escaped during the war, and although some have been seen since, it is not known whether they all survive, who captains them, and if they are still loyal to one another. 

This is a world that is both foreign and familiar to you, ever changing and highly unpredictable. Tread lightly... ... or don't.

DnD,Toss_Away_93,6,"How do I tell my DM I want to start my own campaign? I‚Äôve been playing DnD the with same group of people for a few years, and our most recent campaign is based in Eberron.  Ever since I got my copy of ERLW, I fell in love with the world of Eberron (the aesthetics, the lore, the politics, everything).  There is a lot of material in this book about building adventures, and there are so many interesting places to explore that I‚Äôve asked my DM if we could do some specific adventures.  Every time he responds by telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs up to the group‚Äù, but when I suggest my ideas to the group, they seem more interested in whatever random dungeon he has given us a plot hook for that week, and none of those hooks are ever one of the adventures I asked about. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm still having fun in his campaign, and I want to keep playing in it.  It‚Äôs just gotten to a point where I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever get to experience these adventures unless I start my own campaign.

Since I came to this conclusion, I‚Äôve actually started storyboarding my adventures, naming NPCs, and reading more Eberron lore to add detail to my stories.  I‚Äôm obviously biased, but I think I‚Äôve actually built the start of a really fun campaign.  I even think it would be cool if my campaign and his campaign existed in the same universe, that way we could maybe have tie-in NPCs, or the exploits of one party could be talked about in the other campaign‚Äôs news.  

I want to clear the idea with him before I pitch it to the group.  I just don‚Äôt know how to talk to him about it without him thinking I‚Äôm being critical of his campaign or taking from his pool of future adventure options.  Can anyone give me advice on how to approach this topic with him?

DnD,Arneeman,22,"FYI a ""melee weapon attack"" doesn't require a weapon I've seen a lot of people confused about this subject, so here's a clarification.

**A ""melee weapon attack"" is the collective term for pretty much every melee non-spell attack, using a weapon or not.** 

It's explained in the PHB:

&gt;Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). 

The term is used this way in most stat blocks as well. Here's the wording for a cats claw attack:

&gt;*Claws.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Melee Weapon Attack:* \+0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 slashing damage

If you are still not convinced, here's a quote from Sage Advice:

&gt;What does ‚Äúmelee weapon attack‚Äù mean: a melee attack with a weapon or an attack with a melee weapon?   
&gt;  
&gt;It means a melee attack with a weapon. Similarly, ‚Äúranged weapon attack‚Äù means a ranged attack with a weapon. Some attacks count as a melee or ranged weapon attack even if a weapon isn‚Äôt involved, as specified in the text of those attacks. For example, an unarmed strike counts as a melee weapon attack, even though the attacker‚Äôs body isn‚Äôt considered a weapon. Here‚Äôs a bit of wording minutia: we would write ‚Äúmelee-weapon attack‚Äù if we meant an attack with a melee weapon.

This means that by RAW you can smite and do battlemaster maneuvers with unarmed strikes for example.",1
DnD,Tizzandor,8,"is there a certain mindset for behaviour of NPCs? greetings everyone

I recently remembered a lot of videos and posts about NPC creation, from the time before i started to really get into Pen and Paper.

There were a lot of comments about ""every NPC treating the Players badly"", like looking down on them etc., and also had heard a lot from players that i started DMing for.

so i was wondering; have some of you ever had a gm that made NPCs like that? or when you're a DM; why are the NPCs negative by default?

I've heard stories about shopkeepers who blatantly told the Party to F off, because the ranger looked shady-without any further plot hooks whatsoever and not even racism, because both were humans and every character in the only CoC game i was a player in was brash, rude and it felt like the Gm himself was offended when i tried to bring some roleplay into the Pen and Paper roleplaying game. there were barely more than 2 sentences at a time spoken by any NPC at a time, and almost all of them felt like the GM was annoyed he had to make a voice for them. Mind you; none of the characters except for one were essential or had any clues to give whatsoever. it felt like they were jsut there to be rude.

and that really puzzles me, because when i make NPCs, especially when they're non essential, like shopkeepers, taxi drivers or postmen, who are sometimes just there to get the PCs from point A to point B, I prefer them to be a  nice, jolly, sometimes even positive NPC, instead of some prick behind the counter. it's just more fun for me that way

that came to bite me in the arse a bit already, because in a 50 fathoms game i run, the players kinda fell in love with a certain shopkeeper and always go back to the island he lives on to get their boat fixed, buy ammo and other things

He's a big muscular guy (think Scott Steiner without the bleached hair) and is called Brickunfortunately i gave him a voice to match, so my throat hurts the day after every session. 

Another guy is a postman with a saxonian accent (we play in german-think irish accent like in father ted), in Call of Cthulhu, who likes to talk about the insane things he saw on his route (a fat lady with just a bathrobe, then there came a gust of wind)

So my question is; am i just NPC-ing wrong? and why?

or what is the matter with those types of NPC?",1

When D&amp;D5 came out, we quickly found a group to play the Phandalin adventure from the Starter Set, then ""Princes of the Apocalypse"", and finally ""Murder in Baldur's Gate"", before moving back to ""normal"" board games, where our group originally came from.

After playing a short Call of Cthulhu adventure (2 nights) via Skype, we're now thinking about starting a large D&amp;D campaign again. Question is just: how to do that during a pandemic?

I don't want to run a big campaign via Skype. For board games we're now using Table Top Simulator for our weekly gaming, but for D&amp;D that seems a little fiddly, so I'm having a look at Roll20. Looks nice and seems to work fine for remote groups. Any experiences? Or alternatives?

I saw that Roll20 even sells whole sets for the official adventures, at about the same price as the printed book. But it seems that they're all only available in English, and we'd like to play in German. I'm thinking about buying the German book/PDF and use the maps from there (scan book/cut from PDF, or would there be an issue with copyright even in a closed group?). Would I be missing a lot compared to the sets at Roll20?

And finally, what adventure to play? The group liked the first 2/3 or so of the Princes of the Apocalypse a lot, the ratio of story and fighting was almost right. At the end I (as the DM) had to cut a lot of the dungeons, because it was just more of the same. ""Murder in Baldur's Gate"" on the other hand was a little too much on the story side. I think a few encounters per night are good to keep the balance and have a little variation. Of the other official adventures, ""Ghosts of Saltmarsh"" looks interesting, but I'd also like to level up to 20 with ""Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage"" (although that seems to be the 2nd part in a series, so we'd have to play ""Waterdeep: Dragon Heist"" first?).

My problem occurred yesterday when I had tried scheduling a session for that day, and had given my players plenty of time ahead (2 days in advance, I believe). Only 2/5 players let me know, and one of told me she was unable to make it (which meant a lot more than saying nothing).

Later on, two other players let me know they were unable to come and apologized, which, of course, wasn‚Äôt ideal, but they were really busy that day. 

Finally, the last player has yet to acknowledge this. 

The issue I have with his lack of acknowledgement is that I moved the schedule to fit his, and he never replied if that worked or not. It showed that he viewed all of the messages I had sent later on, but there was no reply.

Finally, I asked checked up on him, and he said he was okay, but never acknowledged the fact that he kinda ghosted our planning.

DnD,Tizzandor,8,"new homebrew mechanic to lightly punish my players for doing really stupid stuff (borrowed from another system) First of all let me say, this might not be for most other groups here, since my group is a bit.... ""special""

We started off with Pen and Paper by playing Kobolds ate my baby, a  fantastic System that is very much about ""GM vs Player, which it even states in the rulebook, where ""the GM should do anything and everything in his power, to kill as many of the players characters as possible""-which is no big problem, since the Kobolds die like flies anyways and character creation takes about 1-2 minutes maximum.

One specific mechanic in the system is the ""death markers"", things the GM should hand out like candy for every and any stupid thing the players or their characters do. you made a stupid joke? Death marker! Quoted Mopnty Python? Death marker (this one is actually in the Rulebook)! Took the last snack before the GM could? Deathmarker!

Those deathmarkers stack up, and every time you get one you roll 2D6 and add the death markers. On a Roll of 14 or more, your character dies.

&amp;#x200B;

so the whole ""death marker"" mechanic is well established in our group and already became a bit of a meme. I didn't want to implement this into my D&amp;D games, until one of my pleyers decided to make a prequel memes comment in the middle of the BBEGs speech (he was talking about getting immense power, so there were a ton og ""UNLIMITED POWER"" comments). This opened the floodgates, and for about 10 minutes there was nothing but prequel memes, only interrupted by ""that's a death marker!""

It was not really pissing me off, rather made me sad, because it really destroyed the fantastic athmosphere that has built up with the group. 

so i worked on a little concept to introduce death markers into D&amp;D as a mechanic. 

you have the same Death marker counters on the char sheet (just make a small checklist on the bottom of the page), roll 2D6 and with a Roll of 14 or more you get 1 level of exhaustion ""because all those bad jokes gave you a migraine""

When the Queen of Lies was slayed

Mad and vile her foe was

An alliance to arrange

And the Guardian of Falsehoods

Could feel the winds of change

When the Maid of Mists was quelled

The Lord of Strife did hunger

For by pow‚Äôr was he bespelled

A bargain then was struck

But the Trickster Queen could not have known

That the Traitor wielded Luck

By Shadowlord forsaken

Godsbane brought her to defeat

DnD,dahelljumper,11,"Tips for Session 1? Hello, tomorrow I am DMing for the first time in a D&amp;D5ExFFXIV homebrew campaign, and it's the first session. I want it to be introductory, mainly because it was supposed to be a one-shot but due to coronavirus we are going to run a whole campaign. I want to make sure I am not missing anything (we'll play on roll20) so I decided to come ask for advice. So far I have:

* The 4 players' character sheets ready to play.
* The overall plot of the campaign well thought out in advance.
* The plot for this specific session.
* Some contingencies in case the party doesn't follow what I have planned.
* NPCs with names and descriptions for when they explore and socialize.
* A list with different types of enemies that they might find.
* A list of music to play during the campaign.
* A quick-glance list of what comes next.

Another friend of mine who's also a DM helped me with the boss, to make sure it was still challenging but not too easy (they all start at level 1). I think I'm good, but I am getting paranoid that I am missing something essential that will stop our playthrough in its tracks. I am good at improvising, but just in case; is there anything else that I need before we play?

Here is a handy campaign setting handout I made for my players, based around a Yorkshire Estate set in 800AD. However, this could easily be transferred into any fantasy setting.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M7rRi-g8xLilmQNvHEH](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M7rRi-g8xLilmQNvHEH)

It was made for a RuneQuest campaign that I've been GMing for the last year and a half, and as such had an awful amount of stats and figures piling up that no one really wanted to interact with. As an example - ( üì∑[https://gyazo.com/fa1ee998c8c56a439182bf1978d11ce8](https://gyazo.com/fa1ee998c8c56a439182bf1978d11ce8) ) - although this is the result of a couple of hours clean up. So I figured I needed to engage the players in the stake that they have, especially with about 6 months/ 1 year in game downtime approaching.

**Within the handout you can find:**

\- A brief history of the Estate.

\- An easy to understand description of the ruling system.

\- A layout of the key buildings both within the Manor and on the Outlying Hides (1 Hide = 120 Acres), and the nearby bandit village that has entered the service of the party (the Ealdormen).

\- A breakdown of the local economy (Income Vs Expenditure).

\- A breakdown of how the monetary system works (Pounds/Shillings/Pence) and some modern day equivalents.

However, my high level end game boss is unrelated to these two, but is going to be there to prey on the results of the disruption to society the two BBEGs before them caused, however their activity might end up happening before the mid level one has been defeated, meaning I may be throwing in plot points which could distract the players from the current threat at hand.

While I wait for things to come together I've started dreaming up new characters, and I hit a slight snag: I only want to play humans. 

D&amp;D has so many exciting non-human races with tons of amazing features, and if this was a videogame I'd pick them in a heartbeat. RP is what I'm interested in, though, and every time I start fiddling with an interesting backstory, ""human"" always seems the best fit. I don't like being hemmed in by racial characteristics, and overall, I think I just enjoy being the one mundane character, with no innate magic or skills.

Ultimately, I think it comes down to the idea of *innateness.* I love playing against type and subverting expectations, but even then you're still banging up against the stereotype you avoided. You're a shy, quiet gnome? Oh my, that's unusual *because most gnomes are so cheerful.* Then again, if I reject racial personalities, will I strip away everything that makes them interesting to just play a human with scales?

(I sort of want to play ""evil races"" as good just to be contrary, but I know a lot of people don't like that and I don't want to come across as a troll / edgelord. It might work in homebrew campaigns.)

DnD,Dovah_bear712,7,"Modifying the sorcerer 5e Hi everyone

I got board the other day so decided to look over the classes. I love scorceres from a thematic standpoint but they get the short end of the stick out of all the casters. They get the fewest number of spells known put of all casters, no ritual casting and you only get limited access to metamagic which is one of the big draws to the class in my eyes. 

I know the purpose of the class is to give up versatility of spells for potency and modification of your limited spells. With that in mind I've trawled through reddit and found some awesome suggestions to improve the baseline sorcerer  making them a more appealing option. Some are big and some small but I just wanted to air them out here to see everyone's opinions on them. 

This is purely discussion and potential implementation for future players at my table as house rules. 

1) Allow them to use the spell point variant in the dmg. That means they could combine their spell points and sorcery points to make a mana pool to spend as they see fit making them a truly flexible caster. This could be overpowered being able to spam more higher level spells (except for sl6-9 which are one only) and cast more spells per day. Thematically I think it fits well with them being imbued with magic and being able to alter it at their will.

2) As magic flows through them they don't require a spellcasting focus or component pouch. If there is a cost to the spell you still require that component to trigger that spell. 

3) You get added spells known depending on your origin at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th level. Eg draconic bloodline gets cause fear, dragons breath, fly etc. Wild magic gets chaos bolt, blink, etc. 

4) Adding an extra metamagic at 6th and 14th level as you learn to control your natural magic.

DnD,starwarper2340,7,"A mess of a session zero I joined a new SKT module on Roll20 a couple hours ago, and we had a ‚Äúsession zero‚Äù to a campaign that started us in the Yawning Portal, each of us looking for work. 

We have a player whom I‚Äôll name Gobby, a barbarian pirate, who was a complete joke character and also a murderhobo. Keep in mind our DM is new, and he‚Äôs only played with a friend who DMed for him who joined us in this game. 

I ran kind of a joke character, Halfling Ranger with a slingshot as his primary weapon, who picked what he thought would be the morally best option. We also had a life cleric, lycanthrope Blood Hunter, and an Artifcier, 

Now Gobby, being a barbarian, decided that being both chaotic neutral, he should take up the fight that the drunk half-orc picked with his posse. We tried to calm him down, but the DM made him roll a wisdom check to see if he flew into a rage (he failed). He started attacking, and we all ran in to the fight. 

As a note, I was told my mic wasn‚Äôt coming in completely so I was cutting in and out sometimes.

These guys came over here with their over-intoxicated friend to specifically pick a fight with an already agitated goblin (he lost his life savings to a tiefling, which they witnessed), then attacked an elderly artificer, a holy priest, and a blind human. 

Now my moral judgement isn‚Äôt the best, but I think that calls for a prevention of loss of life through death. I kill one of the cronies, and the lycanthrope kills another, and Gobby hacks the head off of the Half-orc. 

Now here‚Äôs where the problems become apparent: the life cleric puts his foot down, and refuses to even come close to the party, without hearing us out. No explanation, defenses, anything. I did ask the Barkeeper for a mop to at least clean up the blood, at least. Some arguing ensues, and about 30-45 minutes later and the Cleric hasn‚Äôt budged in the slightest, the DM calls it quits for the night. The DM and the cleric both call out the party for murderhoboing (rightfully so), and asks us not to murderhobo since it didn‚Äôt suit the character descriptions we gave him. 

I get a message from both of them, asking what I thought about the party. I overall like the group, but we all caught the murderhobo disease that Gobby was giving off. I explain my characters actions and apologize to both the cleric and GM for coming off as murderhobo-y, request to change my character to a ranger/gunslinger combo; since I could tell this wasn‚Äôt the joke-character campaign i was assuming this was. 

While Gobby stayed in character, his character subtly impulses our character to break character. And while the Cleric rightfully put his foot down to our OoC murderhobo tendencies, he declined to listen to any defenses any of us had.

Lesson of the Story? #Know what campaign you‚Äôre getting into.# if you have a joke hobo, make sure everyone‚Äôs OK with it. I like the group and I don‚Äôt know how the DM is handling the situation as of right now, but session zero was a terrible mess. That‚Äôs why we have them, to sort out these kinks",1

DnD,jedimasta,17,"How SHOULD a DM handle this trap check? I realize there may not be a single 'right' answer, but being as new as I am to running my own games I wanted to try and get a broader perspective.

The setup is simple enough. There's a large statue on the back wall of a hallway. A 10x10 pressure plate that activates a poison gas trap from the statue's mouth in on the ground 5ft away. Now, I have no doubt my rogue player is gonna want to check for traps (which has caused a hair of drama in the past).

So, when he inevitably says ""I check for traps"" my intent is to ask for specifics like where/what he's checking. Is it correct to assume that if he says ""I check the statue"" without calling out the floor in front of the statue, that I'm well within my rights to trigger the trap, because he missed or failed to look at the floor? Rules as Written are thus:

&gt; Someone who examines the proper location and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom check notices the pressure plate. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves‚Äô tools disarms the trap; the pressure plate can also be deactivated by physically jamming it so that it can‚Äôt move. 

'proper location' is what kinda triggered my question. If he just walks up to the statue, giving no mind to the floor, can I pop it on him? I want to avoid the whole ""no, I checked!"" or ""I never even rolled"" argument if I can. I might be overthinking it, but I wanted some ammo in my chamber in case the experience goes south.

BONUS QUESTION:

How long are thieves tools supposed to last? Like, how many usages should one set get? I've already told my players that if they should crit fail a check using them, that they would break and either trip the trap they wanted to disarm or permanently lock the door they've been trying to pick. I didn't see anything specific in the DMG or PH (5e) to rule otherwise.",1

My father's ""curse"" being that his first born child (me!) would be a danger to everyone around him (which, lets be honest: giving a child uncontrollable magical powers is incredibly dangerous) causing him to never marry and to never have a child out of fear of what his child might become. 

But alas, one day a child was delivered to his doorstep with a piece of paper marked with the symbol of the being who had ""cursed"" him all those years ago. He decided to stop running from fate and raise this child as his own. And as the boy grew older, he started to look like the spitting image of his presumably adoptive father.

DnD,GM_Forest,12,"Looking for mission ideas for a Sci-Fi campaign set in the Mass Effect universe For those not familiar with the Mass Effect lore, here is the needed tidbit. Humanity finally started to colonize other planets by use of a relay system that allowed them to go much further than typical FTL style drives could. When reactivating a long dormant Relay, humanity was attack by an unknown alien force. These attackers followed the last remaining ship back to their colony and started a 3 month long occupation of the human colony, Shanxi. My campaign will start at the news of the attack and play through these 3 months. My PCs will be a Black Ops team sent by the human military to investigate, harass, and breakdown this unknown alien threat by guerilla tactics in space and on land.

I have a solid beginning and end to the conflict but need some ideas for various content that happens in the middle of it to bridge the gap and give the PCs something meaningful to do while they are not the primary boots on ground during the conflict. **If needed this is a D&amp;D 5e campaign using a fanmade conversion that can be found** [**HERE**](https://n7.world)**.**

Additional information below given for those familiar to the Mass Effect universe. 

**General concept**: Players are the first group of N7 graduates alongside David Anderson, an NPC, and get word that Shanxi is under attack by an unknown alien force. The campaign will cover the next 3 months known to Humanity as the First Contact War.

**Details**: The players will be put under command of a black ops team where they, as the ground team, will have a Normandy-like experience of being on their own ship playing by their own rules trying to attack this unknown threat and discover any information on this threat so that the 2nd Fleet can have an edge against them when they arrive to retake Shanxi.

I have the start of the campaign completely planned out as well as the next 4-5 sessions. Since it is a military based campaign the players know that they will be a bit more directed than normal, as their ""orders"" come in telling them where to go or with intel they will need to check out.

**Advice/Help needed**: What are some good mission ideas for my PCs that would be right for that timeline. I never read the books that occur around this time (Revelations and Evolutions) but I know that the mercenary Jack Harper came to Shanxi to assist the colonists after General Williams surrendered. I would like to incorporate this a bit in the second half of the campaign but am looking for more filler missions to get to this point.

The PCs will have their own ship with a slew of NPCs (limited crew like the Normandy) but the commanding officer will be an NPC. However, as the N7s they will be the one's leading the ground assault and away missions.

Examples of missions that I have thought of are as follows:

* Asteroid mission: Stop the Alien threat from throwing a huge asteroid into the colony to utterly destroy it and to end the conflict - Similar to the DLC in ME2 to destroy the Relay near the Batarians
* Extraction mission: High ranking person is captured and needs to be extracted (unsure if this will take place in space, on Shanxi, or somewhere else)
* Pirate Ship: PCs are attacked and are boarded by mercenaries
* Distress call: PCs respond to a human ship putting out a distress call; Board the ship to find it abandoned or as a trap

**TLDR: Please suggest mission ideas that are classic to the ME universe and general Science Fiction (Think Halo, Battle Star Galactica, and Star Wars for level of technology) that take place during the First Contact War with an unknown alien threat.**",1
DnD,RoguishRat,1,"Advice? Niche feat and bonus activity I'm looking for a little advice on creating a niche feat.  Bonus point activity at the end.

I'm in a 2 player (plus DM) game where we're both monks just gaining 3rd level; he's Kensei and I'm Way of the Drunken Master.  Full transparency, I'm ripping off the Jackie Chan movie.  I want to go all-out with his style of using everything around to fight, but the Tavern Brawler feat isn't great for me.  The only thing I can really use from it is proficiency in improvised weapons:  the +1 Str or Con aren't very useful to me since I went Dex and am a Hill Dwarf and the other things are redundant for a monk or based on Str that I don't have.

&amp;#x200B;

I also found a homebrew feat that is interesting but still not what I really want:

Improvised Weapon Master

You are a master at weaponizing anything and everything.

\*When wielding an improvised weapon, its damage becomes 1d6 rather than 1d4.

\*You also add half your proficiency bonus to attack and damage rolls made with improvised weapons, rounded down.

\*After rolling for initiative, you make your first attack with an improvised weapon at advantage. You do not gain this benefit again until you take a short or long rest.

&amp;#x200B;

This also is somewhat redundant for my character, so I‚Äôm trying to cobble together something else.  It will admittedly be pretty specific for my character, but the DM is okay with that.  What I‚Äôve got so far is

\+1 to Str or Dex

Improvised weapons are monk weapons.

\[Blatantly steal the last part of Improvised Weapon Master for lack of another idea.\]

&amp;#x200B;

Any clever ideas for how to make my character more like Jackie Chan?

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Point Activity:  The DM is having us find pamphlets of moves we‚Äôre calling Esoteric Techniques, little things that will add kung fu power to our two-person party and further individualise the characters once we learn enough (we‚Äôll set a limit of a few we can take into any given battle).  The example we have so far is if we move at least 10 ft toward an enemy we can gain Advantage on an attack (we may end up specifying it to activate only once per encounter if that gets too strong).

DnD,spaceninjas1234,3,"[OC] New player here! Looking for help with my wood elf monk :) Hello! I am new to DnD and I wanted help making a more interesting backstory for the character I'm creating. Her name is Xingwyn, she's a wood elf monk who is a part of an artisan guild. I was thinking that she might have entered the monastery by her own merit, desiring a more disciplined life (perhaps running away from some sort of wrong-doing she may have been involved in?). She worked hard for years and gained much from her time, yet came to terms with the fact that the harsh rigid life was not for her. She's extraordinarily beautiful, yet she knows it. She's passionate about the work she creates, yet she tends to get cocky, expecting everyone to be already highly aware of who she is. She's a chaotic good and, I know...I've already heard debates about whether or not a monk could be chaotic. However, after reading a lot on the concepts of all involved I think this is easily possible! Perhaps she's extremely well-disciplined, yet may have a tendency to fall towards an eccentric and sporadic way of living? She did leave the monastery after all!

I'm aware that it's possible my character might be a tad generic, expected as she was created entirely with the handbook by my side. I would love it if I could add some sort of flair to her personality that would mix up her story a little bit and make her more interesting to play. As my first time playing the game, I would love to hear things I could do to this character that could not only make her have more compelling of a story but also makes my gameplay more exciting! I've never played, however, I am extraordinarily excited and ready to fully dive in headfirst. I'm open to any and all thoughts and ideas! :) :) :) Thank you!",1

So me and the barbarian have been heckling eachother, I don't even remember over what, but I do remember how the heckling stopped and the whole party thought I was secretly a god.

Here's how it went:

Party is wandering the workd looking for an adventure to start

Me and barbarian heckling eachother

Barbarian: ""You better stfu tiny man, 'fore I punt 'cross the river""

Me: ""You'll have to find me first"" I rolled a stealth check to hide, dm said at disadvantage.

Whole party fails checks to find me

Barbarian:""Coward must've run off. God riddance""

As far as they know they've been making checks to look for bandits and dangerous animals

After a few days party meets a man looking for help. He says he escaped from a nearby city where the leaders have recently began acting strange. He says no ones allowed in or out and the city is in poverty because of it, and that we need to speak with some NPC in the city to help them.

Party travels to city, still unknowing about their gnome friend following.

They get to city and guards stops them, they bicker with guards to let them in but guards are firm, party starts to look like they're gonna fight their way in.

I decide to put my skills to good use. Roll stealth to get past guards while they bicker with party, passed with room to spare. Once inside, I make my move

Me, yelling to guards: ""Hey, Leader says to let them in they have an appointment"" give them the 'well you don't want to piss off leader do you' speech, they let party in with no fight

Party: ""Wait how did you get here? I thought you left?""

Me: ""Oh, I never left. I was always with you""

Barbarian: ""Where? i never saw you?""

Me: ""Thats because you weren't looking""

Barbarian: ""But I was looking, very hard so i could punt you 'cross that river""

Me: ""Well its a good thing you didn't find me then, other wise you'd never have gotten into the city and NPC would have to solve this mess themselves""

Second is the random murder. He can have people killed other ways. Simply cause a bar fight to start a fight and watch the rest of the party enjoy doing there thing in it, while expecting people to die. Or he sneaks out the back for a night of his own debauchery, ex. robbing houses, there is a thieves guild in most settings.

Mean while on down time he could be starting a uprising of the poor against the nobility. This is a reason that rumors are a thing. Mean while being just a clown he can pass it off as satire, causing a stage, and reason for the guards not to beat his ass, at least not every time.

Main reason I could see this not working is the DM not wanting to run the story in that direction. But they would know this is coming from session 0. Which they would have time to say no, your character is evil, not the player.

Basically CE doesn't mean kills everything themselves, they can encourage others to do it for them. They can break a city themselves by swaying the people inside of it. They also don't have to let the party see anything that they do that is evil.",1

DnD,harricrossknight,5,"How Mending a Shirt Led to the BBEG's Death  A little while back I played my second D&amp;D Adventure League game. This wasn't just my second game of Adventure League, it was my second game ever. And somehow,  I managed to almost kill the entire party of our 8 players and turned the entire thing around with a single cantrip.  

I decided to go to our local comic store with my brother and now fianc√© for their first session. Our group of 8 players had mostly picked from pre-made characters before the session. The players already there were a few drow rogues, a ranger, a wizard (which had downed me with fireball my first session), and barbarian that had an obsession collecting toes. If that last part was any indication, most of them were firth graders. My brother chose a human paladin while my fianc√© chose a human fighter. I decided to play a bard named Chris Tomlin, a pure minded master of disguise. 

Our DM for that night was none other than a store worker who just happened to be there when they were short a DM. And let me tell you, this guy was amazing. The lackluster DM I had my first game paled in comparison to this dude. 

We were tasked with infiltrating an Orc stronghold to retrieve two magical stones and some stolen barrels full of coffee beans. Upon entering the cavern, the part of the group that consisted of everyone except my brother, my fianc√©, and me went into the first room. They were greeted by the Orcs there and combat ensued. 

At that time I wasn't much of a fan for combat and opted to disguise myself as an Orc and go a different direction. I was followed by my fianc√© and my brother.

Yep, I split the party. 

For one reason or another my fianc√© got the opportunity to enter the next room and did so first, to which she was met with a flurry of teeth and weapons. She was knocked down. Using my dark vision, I could tell there were more Orcs in this room along with their hounds. My brother noped the heck out of there and ran back to the the rest of our party. 

Ah yes, the rest of our party. The wizard was firing off fireballs in any direction, the drow rogues were taking hits left and right, and our barbarian was the only one doing any real damage to the orcs there. And it was about to get *much* worse for them. 

In the other room, I had cast Tongues to speak to the Orcs and try to save my fianc√©.

Me: ""Can you please-""

Orcs: ""WHAT YOU SAY?""

I realized the DM was showing what the orcs sounded like and followed suit.

Me: ""I want to persuade them to leave her alone.""

DM: ""Well, you're going to have to convince them that there's something better they could do. Like, maybe that there are better prisoners""

Me: ""YOU DON'T WANT THIS SCRAWNY PRISONER! LOOK HOW FAST YOU DEFEAT HER! PROBABLY BETTER PRISONERS SOMEWHERE.""

The DM smiled and said that the Orcs were so excited about this idea that they unchained their hounds and ran off yelling ""BETTER PRISONERS!""

Well... shoot. 

In the other room the party stood little chance against two rooms worth of enemies. My brother tried to heal others there as best as he could as the drows went down and failed their saving throws. The ranger had gone back to the start of the dungeon and built a wooden barricade to trap himself inside. The hounds and orcs alike descended upon the party and it was thanks to the master of disguise Chris Tomlin the bard.

In my mind I began to form a plan as I cast mend on some nearby chains to make handcuffs for my finac√© (to which the entire party railed on me about). My plan was to slowly make my way through the dungeon, find the BBEG who most likely had the items we needed, and brake the cuffs while we double teamed them. Hopefully, the rest of the party would be brought to us and we could escape with the needed items. 

As we began to make our way through the dungeon, we made it to the center room where we found a rather swole Orc with exercise equipment. 

Bingo, I thought.

Me: ""HI BIG BOSS, I HAVE PRISONER FOR YOU.""

Swole Orc: ""WHAT, ME NO BIG BOSS, ME NAME SHAWN.""

And the ruse was broken.

I broke my fianc√©'s cuffs as she went to attack Shawn.

Miss. Did I forget to mention I hadn't healed her?

With one bonk of the flat of his axe, my fianc√© was knocked unconscious again. 

In the other room, the orcs ceremoniously shouted, ""BETTER PRISONERS!"" over the unconscious bodies of what remained of our party.

Which left me, the Bard with a rapier against a jacked orc and his two axes.

With a mighty slash, I struck... and ripped his shirt. And at that point I realized I wasn't beating this guy.

So after I survived his next attack which did a fair amount of damage, I did the only logical thing left to do.

I cast mend on his shirt.

Looking down at his shirt, Shawn was fairly pleased that I had done him this service, completely forgetting that I had been the one that, you know, *ripped it in the first place.*

Shawn: ""YOU FIX SHAWN'S SHIRT! OH, YOU BEST BUD NOW!""

Me: ""YEAH... ME SORRY ME ATTACK YOU. ME THOUGHT YOU WERE BIG BOSS MAN.""

Shawn, clearly flattered: ""WHAT ME? NO, BIG BOSS MAN MUCH BIGGER THAN ME.""

Me: ""YOU KNOW... YOU SHOULD BE THE BIG BOSS MAN!""

And with a decent persuasion role, Shawn thought this was a good idea. 

Shawn: ""YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU RIGHT! SHAWN SHOULD BE BIG BOSS MAN!""

And with that, he allowed me to help my fianc√© up and our mission became clear: we were to go find and kill the big boss himself.

In the other room, the party's luck began to change. The orcs began fighting each other over who would get to take the best prisoner and they literally began killing each other. My brother, the wizard, and the sorcerer all passed their saving throws and managed to fight their way back from death. 

For as strong as he was, Shawn had no sense of direction for the place. We wandered about until the rest of the party caught up with us. Finally we came across a small chasm with a river of lava below. We were greeted by fire dwarfish beings who were actually in favor of Shawn becoming the new chieftain. 

My brother, the wizard, the sorcerer, and my fianc√© all made a successful athletics check to make it to the other side. With one mighty vault Shawn tripped over his shoes and tumbled down into the lava below.

Me: ""SHAWN!""

I rolled to pass my athletics check, thinking we would just have to do this without him. I of course failed as well and fell into the lava below. I should note that at this point I miscalculated my actual health and should have died, a point I later brought up to the DM, who dismissed it for the reason of having fun. As I struggled in the lava, I saw someone *swimming* through the lava.

Shawn, the chad of chads, the orc of orcs, ferried me to the other side of that lava river on his back.

After an obviously needed long rest in the cavern, we went to the orc shaman and the group of orcs guarding the big boss. They acknowledged his challenge and after they cut out his eye and my fianc√©'s eye (who jumped in front of me as I was going to do so) for their god, they let us pass. 

We approached a door where Shawn bellowed for his boss to come out. And the boss did.

His bulging mass could almost barely fit through the doorway as his comically fit form broke through the door.

Big Boss: ""WHAT YOU WANT SHAWN?""

Shawn: ""ME THE BIG BOSS NOW!""

Big Boss: ""GO HOME SHAWN, YOU DRUNK!""

And with one mighty cleave of his axe, the big boss cut into Shawn, ripping his shirt and creating a gash across his chest.

The DM rolled what I assume was Shawn's constitution saving throw. I thought for sure he would back down...

Shawn: ""NO, ME *WILL* BECOME BIG BOSS MAN!""

At that point a goblin with some bombs lobbed one at the party and the three fire dwarves that had followed us. The dwarves were instantly killed, and the rest of the party was left with low hp. The wizard, of course, cast fireball on the goblin, causing it and everything in the room to be instantly burnt to a crisp. 

My brother used all 25 of his Lay on Hands to heal Shawn's wounds. As the fight continued, we buffed and supported Shawn as he faced the BBEG, mono a mono. 

Finally, Shawn brought his two axes down into the shoulders of the big boss, carving an X through his torso before he made it all the way through the brute's body. Shawn, the mad lad himself, had won us the game.

Well, almost...

The missing barrels were quite charred when we found them in the room where the wizard had cast the fireball. Still, Shawn was willing to give us the stone he had found in that room and persuaded the shaman to give us his stone. 

The DM persuaded us we could try and kill Shawn and the BBEG during the fight, but I was so taken up with the character he made that I couldn't kill the NPC.

Oh, and as for that ranger who barricaded himself in: Shawn called him a coward before tracking him down and also taking an eye from him.

One vender has a lot of spell scrolls for sale. A couple cantrips like friends, message and minor illusion are available but the big spell available that I really want is greater invisibility. 
The problem is I‚Äôm a level 5 arcane Trickster and my natural spell progression doesn‚Äôt give me level 4 spells until level 18!

I have the money to buy this spell scroll (I stole it!) but what‚Äôs the best play here to get these spells locked in long term and ahead of schedule?? 

The best plan I can think of is buying the scrolls and seeing if my wizard friend can copy the scrolls into his spell book, I could then multi class into wizard and get my own spell book and recopy the spells so i can use them on myself. Does this work?

DnD,Dr0gbasH3AD,7,"As a DM would you allow this character to wear heavy armor? Radagon the hill dwarf has always had a fascination with nature especially with earth and lightning in particular. One night he had a strange dream that during the next thunderstorm he was to chase it and that he would know what to do when ‚Äúinspiration struck‚Äù. When the next storm came he went out into the thick of it and chased the storm for miles and miles until it finally stopped, however it started condensing above a very small lone mountain (some might call it an enormous hill) with a single tree upon it and once he got to the top there was a crack. In the same instant lighting struck the tree and an image of a hammer flashed into his mind‚Äôs eye. He spent the next 3 days chiseling and carving away everything that wasn‚Äôt his blessed hammer. 

Radagon is burly and a bit tall for a dwarf. He is light skinned with green eyes and brown hair with a long bushy beard. One of the most striking things about him is his peculiar intricately carved completely wooden hammer (shillelagh‚Äôd club or yew that takes in the spores de of a large 1 handed hammer) and he dons a curious round shield depicting a mountain, a single tree and two lightning strokes embossed upon it.

He‚Äôs a Cleric (tempest) 3/Druid X

Regarding the ruling does it change things if I start as a cleric vs starting as a Druid? While I‚Äôd rather start as a Druid for spells I have no issue starting as a cleric if that what it takes to make people turns blind eye to the Druid heavy armor thing.

The way I look at my character is as an improved nature cleric. I wish the nature cleric sub class had some lightning or other more elemental kinds of spells. Also the other spells they do have are pretty disappointing imho. I‚Äôd want the world to relate to Radagon as a nature cleric. I think the circle of the land mountain Druid and tempest cleric fit this dwarf quite nicely.

Anyway please let me know if your thoughts. I hope this armor thing won‚Äôt hurt my chances of finding an experienced DM too hard since they are already hard to come by these days!!

DnD,Psychomaniac14,12,"So, you've come across the max AC build and want to hit it? (5e guide) You came across a guy who followed every step in my max AC guide and you were completely unable to hit him, yes? Don't worry, it's possible to get a + to hit so great that you're only gonna miss on a nat 1, and that even bypasses some of the max AC build's pluses to AC, so really it's all good. Just follow this guide, which is simpler than the max AC guide, and you'll get an absurd + to hit in no time!

# Step 1 - Picking your weapon

This step is pretty simple. Just get the right weapon. Go with a bow, because then it ignores the max AC builds Defensive Duelist feat, reducing their AC from 82 to 73. Also, the multiattack defense can be ignored too by only hitting once, further reducing their AC to **69**. But reducing their AC against you isn't all you can do with picking a bow. There are more effects that increase your + to hit for ranged weapons than there are for melee weapons.

# Step 2 - Classes

Next you gotta get your classes. First things first, get ranger 20 for Foe Slayer, which gives +Wis to hit. Along the way, get the Archery fighting style for another +2. If you have 20 Dex and 20 Wis, your + to hit should already be +12 without magic items or proficiency bonus. If your DM allows going into epic levels, also get War Cleric 2 and Battle Master Fighter 18 for Channel Divinity: Guided Strike (flat +10) and Precision Strike (+ superiority die, which is a d12 at level 18) which both really help a lot. Now your + to hit is +22+1d12 without magic items or proficiency bonus. Add in your +11 proficiency bonus from being level 40 to get +33+1d12.

# Step 3 - Magic Stuff

Starting off super simple, +3 bow, +3 arrow, Oil of Sharpness, because they all stack. Next, Banner of the Krig Rune for Gift of Battle (+1). Yes, this is also used in max AC, but it works. After that, Bracers of Archery for another +2. Now your + to hit is +45+1d12. Add an Ioun Stone - Mastery for +46+1d12. Increase Dex and Wis to 30 for +56+1d12. But there's still more you can do. Chug a Potion of Heroism for an extra d4, and have a friend give you Bardic Inspiration for an extra d12 if their bard level is 15 or more.

That's it. +56+1d4+2d12. Minimum +59, average +71, maximum +84 which is even higher than the max AC build's AC when at maximum! I hope you enjoyed reading this guide. Comment below for anything that could increase + to hit further, and I'll add it with credit if it works. Of course, you could keep increasing your level for a greater proficiency bonus, but that doesn't count, because we want minimum level for max + to hit (before adding proficiency bonus)",1

Aside from that, I know many of you will say I should look for a group, thing is i am really scared of it and I would like to not do that if possible.

2: How can I try to talk my brothers and their girlfriends and mine into it, whats the best way, maybe some game that not really that hard but has the similiar concept, something that comes to your mind ?
3: I would really like to be a player, but if it means to connect them and make them play, should i learn everything for DM ?

Fortunately, there's a set of variant spell point rules on page 288 of the DMG. This seemed to me to match up really well with the whole Sorcerer vibe, and if we're turning spell slots into points, then why not combine them with Sorcery Points as well?

A few things to note:

* According to the spell point rules, spell slots of 6th level and higher can only be used once per long rest (i.e. no casting two 7th-level spells in one day). I've considered removing this restriction but am keeping it for now.
* I multiplied Sorcery points by .75 before adding them in as a way to account for the increased versatility.
* I'm ruling that only single-class Sorcerers can use this spellcasting method.",1
DnD,terminhell,5,"First time Player And DM Last weekend I picked up the Essentials Kit from target. I've read up to the first three quests it suggests offering the party, and most of the rule book. I do watch quite a few d&amp;d YouTube channels, and have listened to all of season two critical role. Tomorrow evening I plan on running this with my wife, who started working on an elven rogue, and her sister/husband.

I've made some brief notes on the starting town, elaborated on the shrine of luck(offering plates that have 1 sided coins for example), and a few minor notes on the other two quests. 

Anything I can do to help make a group of first timers(including me the DM) not feel bogged down with character creation, or pacing of the game. I'm not sure how long they plan on being here, so this will essentially be session zero and one at once.

DnD,nz8drzu6,25,"DM kills all our characters in first session for the sake of story I wanted to join a campaign where we could make characters starting at mid-levels (because I hate grinding the first 5 levels), and I found a DM in a Discord group doing a homebrew campaign advertising that we can all make level 16 characters for the first session.

After some epic backstory about this evil fiend lurking in the deepest lairs of a dungeon, we (sorcerer, cleric, paladin) ventured in to try and kill the demon, only to learn the demon had 25 AC and the ability to turn a failed saving throw into a successful one, once a turn. After expending most of our spells, it was clear we had to run. We tried to teleport out but the demon casted a reaction spell that disables teleports. We then tried to run and the demon casted Power Word Stun (a homebrew variant that targets AoE), furthermore he said this type of stun can't be broken out of by CON saves. Needless to say, we all died.

Afterwards, he let us create new level 2 characters and said the original characters were going to die no matter what for the sake of the prologue. I feel kinda cheated that we didn't actually have a choice in deciding our fates.",1

DnD,SLICKWILLIEG,10,"My take on the Testudo, a real battle formation used by the Romans. The Testudo (or tortise) formation was a famous Roman battle tactic as seen [here.] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Wenceslas_Hollar_-_A_testudo.jpg/800px-Wenceslas_Hollar_-_A_testudo.jpg) I wanted to make it into a real thing to challenge my players in a future encounter, and wanted to know what you guys thought. Currently built it for a 10x10 formation, could be scaled up or down as needed. Any advice or criticisms welcome.

**Testudo**

*Gargantuan Swarm of Medium Humanoids, any alignment*

---

AC: 20

HP: 500 (100x(1d6+1))

Speed: 20ft

---

STR: 13 (+1)

DEX: 9 (-1)

CON: 13 (+1)

INT: 10 (0)

WIS: 12 (+1)

CHA: 10 (0)

---

Skills: Intimidation (+6)

Saves: Wisdom (+4), Charisma (+3)

Senses: Passive Perception 11

Languages: Common

Challenge 9 (5,000xp)

---
*Phalanx*: For every 5 hp the Testudo loses, a creature in the formation dies. Each time this happens, the AC of the row he belonged to reduces by 1 (this represents gaps forming in the shield wall). 

*Tight Formation*: The Shields that make up the Testudo are so tightly held together that they prevent any creature from being able to see into it. Ranged attacks against the Testudo are made at disadvantage. The Testudo has disadvantage on all Dexterity Saving Throws. 

*Sentinels*: Opponents provoke an attack of opportunity against the Testudo when they enter its reach. Opponents within the Testudo's reach provoke an attack of opportunity even if they took the disengage action. Any opponent hit by an attack of opportunity has its speed reduced to zero for the rest of its turn. 

*Martial Advantage*: A creature in the Testudo adds 2d6 to its damage roll when there is at least one other creature adjacent to it's immediate left or right.

*Disciplined Attacks*: Every member of the front two lines of the Testudo may make one melee attack only to the squares directly in front of it. They may not attack diagonally or to the side, unless they are on the edge of the formation. 

*Stand Together*: When the Testudo is above 75% of its starting HP, it has advantage on all saving throws made against charm or fear affects. The Testudo loses this ability once it goes below 75% of its starting HP. 

*Route*: When the Testudo loses 50% of its starting HP, it must make a DC Wisdom 10 saving throw. If it fails, the creatures of the Testudo all take on the frightened condition and begin a route. If the Testudo succeeds its save, it does not route. Each time the Testudo loses more than 10HP on a creatures, it must make another Wisdom saving throw. Each successful save increases the DC of the save by 1. If the Testudo goes below 25% of its starting HP but has not yet routed, it makes this save at disadvantage. 

---
**Actions**

*Multiattack*: The Testudo makes two pike thrusts and one Javelin Barrage.

*Pike Thrust. Melee weapon attack*: Every member of the front two lines of the Testudo may make one melee attack only to the squares directly in front of it. The pike thrust from the front line has a reach of 10 ft, and the thrust from the second line has a reach of 5 ft. +4 to hit. *Hit* 7 (1d10+1) piercing damage. 

*Javelin Barrage*: The creatures of the Testudo fling javelins into an area 20ft long by 50ft wide up to 70ft in front of the formation. any creatures in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity save, taking 11 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

---
**Legendary Actions**

The Testudo can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

*Close Ranks.* The creatures of the Testudo move to close all gaps in the formation, each individual moving up to 20ft in any direction necessary. 

*War Cry* The Testudo makes an intimidation roll against all creatures within 50ft of it, contested against the creature(s) Wisdom Saving throw.",1

""Alright Vur, pick her up, lets go see if Miss Migger here's telling the truth.""

Vurdaar, hefting Rend over his shoulder, looks you up and down, concerned.

""Are you sure, Arry? Your very wet with blood. I don't want you to die, Arry.""

You look down at your hand, covering the makeshift bandage, damming the torrent of blood that might otherwise be gushing from the stab wound left in you gut. You are starting to feel somewhat tired; if not from the now distant hangover, you think that maybe you should at least rest.

""Yeah, Vur, I'm okay. Let's just go find Bexits cart so we can get paid, then we'll go find an apothecary.""

Vurdaar, with a hint of caution in his voice, turns back to the street:

""Okay, Arry. Just don't bleed much anymore, please?""

""Heh, sure thing big guy.""

As you make your way out to the street, you look across to the Bloody Fist. The bedlam in the rundown tavern seems to have attracted a small audience of passerby's, onlooking from the windows. Suddenly, the crowd in front of the door parts, and two men, holding tight to one anothers shirt collars, bursts out onto the street, repeatedly wailing on each others face. As the two men proceed to maim one another, the gathered crowd cheers, and several spectators begin pulling out coins, betting on the outcome of the match.

As you start your way down the street, Rend starts shouting, trying to draw attention form the gathered crowd across the way:

""HEY! YOU ALL! HELP ME, THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ME!""

With a practiced grace, Vurdaar whips Rend over his shoulder, slamming her to the muddy ground with a wet smack, knocking her unconscious. Startled, you recoil, yelling back at the Goliath:

""Damn, Vur! I could have just gagged her, did you just kill her?!""

""No way, Arry! Wrestling isn't for killing people, it's just for beating them!""

As you reach down to check her pulse, you look up to see only a few face in the mob looking your way. 

""Don't worry folks, she's just drunk, we're taking her home!""

What few people had noticed you quickly lose interest, diverting their attention back to the fighting duo wrestling in the mud before them. Neither man seemed to have the upper hand. If you could have framed the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, this was it.

Touching your fingers to Rends neck, you feel the slight bumping of her pulse, and you exhale a sigh of relief.

""Be more careful next time, Vur. We need her to point out that storehouse, and she very well can't do that if she's dead.""

""But...""

""And yes, you could have killed her. She's not one of your kind. She's more fragile; hitting her head like that could do her in.""

Vurdaar again reaches down, picking up Rend and slinging her over his shoulder. Keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.

""I'm sorry, Arry. I just didn't want to get in trouble.""

""It's okay, big guy. At least you did keep us out  of trouble, right?""

You pat his shoulder, and he looks back up to you with a sheepish smile on his face.

As the two of you make your way south, the clouds that had gathered overhead begin to darken as you hear the distant rumbling of thunder. It will probably start raining soon, but you look forward to the refreshing shower, considering the day you've had.

As you walk further south, through the dank streets and ramshackle corridors of the Dock Ward, you barely catch but a glance from the sparse populace that notice you. Were it not for the blood running down the front of your garb and the horns protruding from your skull, you were sure nobody would have noticed the unconscious woman slung over your companions massive shoulder. As you walk, you notice the walls emerging from behind the buildings to your front. *We must be close.*

You look around for anything that might resemble a grain store, and see a silo peeking up from behind the buildings to your right.   You tear a strip of cloth from the tattered bottom of Rend's dress, and tie knot in the center before tying it around Rend's mouth.

""Vur, can I see your little wake-up vial?""

Vurdaar reaches into his coinpurse and flips you the small, odorous instrument. You take a deep breath, and open the container directly under Rends nose, waking her with a start. She struggles briefly, attempting to shout curses at you before realizing the muzzle you applied was letting out nothing more than muffled tones. You grab her hair, and look her directly in the eyes.

""Alright Rend, are we close?""

Rend looks around the locale, and nods her head, gesturing in the direction of the silo that you had spotted a moment ago. You direct Vurdaar to lead the way through an alley leading to the docks and the front of the building you suspected contains the stolen goods. As you emerge from the alley, you are greeted again with the docks, now all but empty as the clouds overhead have darkened considerably further, and the wind begins to buffet violently. Far off on the horizon, you see the flashes of light as the lightning attacks the sea without relent, and the distant rumble of their strikes slowly morphs into a repetitive booming. With her facing the line of stores ,you look back to Rend.

""Alright, which one is it?""

Rend looks directly to one of the bay doors lining the building behind you, nodding her head in affirmation. You make your way over to the large doors, and find them to be unlocked. Opening the doors, you are greeted with a room whose flanks are piled high with cloth sacks, over flowing with grain, and in the middle, the unmistakable shape of a cart, poorly veiled with a large piece of canvas.

""Vur, get in here and close the door. We don't want any surprises in here.""

Taking care to handle her gently, Vurdaar sets Rend down on a pile of spilled grain before moving back to the door and closing it. You lift the canvas on the cart, and find sacks of a flour-like powder. *This must be it.* *Rend must be...* Before you think the accusation, you notice the short, unmarked crates at the front of the cart. Moving over to them, you lift the lid off the first one you reach. 

The crate is full of bottles. Inspecting one, you read '*Pretty Penny's Peppy Panacea.'* Rend was right.

DnD,Gangrel_,0,"How my players defeated the Dark Lord Covid the 19th This is a copy paste of a post that i made in another subreddit and im doing this becasue first im lazy to reinvent the story for another subreddit  and second i don't think of another better way of telling the tale.

This  story is from a charity game i ran in a discord server, the proceture  was that every time a game was completed the mods of the server would  add about 5 to 10 USD to a money pool that was donated to the  institutions that are investigating and finding a solution to the COVID  19 itself and the adventure was named ""IN THE FACE OF PERIL!"".

Knowing  that it was a charity event i had to plan for a oneshot and what better  idea than making a villain based on the disease itself, thus Dark Lord  Necromancer Covid the 19th was born. I never had GMd 5e so my area of  expertise is Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic and Expert rules (B/X from the  1980s in short) and rules related OSRs (Old School Rennaisance /  Revival).

This game was run in the  OSR ""Labyrinth Lord"" my favorite Retro Clone of the B/X aside from ""Old  School Essentials"" i always preach about how people should play old  school stuff among other things (being a younger myself this statement  is funny at least for me) and somehow got a quick and nice group of  players wanting to join because they really liked the risky theme of the  idea of fighting a personification of the COVID 19th in a charity game.

So  there was a fighter, a cleric, a thief, a Magic User and an Elf (in  this game demi-human races are their own classes) aligned to the forces  of law and neutrality (back then Good and Evil weren't on the alignment  choices, only law and chaos) and so they started helping setting up the  defenses of the Slavic city of Rivacheg (yes, i know) to the upcoming  assault of the chaos army of Dark Lord Covid the 19th.

The  set up of the events were like this, the Dark Lord long ago started a  war declaring himself the ""Everchosen of the gods of chaos"" (really i  won't hide that i ripped off many things to make this oneshot work) and  started destroying, ravaging and conquering the lands far and wide  through the world, turning off the great beacons of law, on the one shot  his conquest was in a pretty advanced state, where only a couple of  bastions of law remained and the players had to make a stand with the  surviving soldiers and adventurers of the Gaia.

The  fighter rolled himself like an arthurian paladin from Camelot, brave  and with a great leadership aiding the speech of the nervous commanders  who were on the edge knowing what was going on in the region, the cleric  was a classic orphan girl who fought and managed to reach the high  standing of Vicar within her religion in the name of the sun god, the  thief rolled like a Darkest Dungeon grave robber, scouting, throwing  knives and backstabing with a pickaxe, the magic user and the elf were  loremasters one of them looked like Stregobor from the Witcher and the  Elf looked like the elves from ""the broken sword"" book from Poul  Anderson.

After setting up the  defenses by rallying the soldiers and raising the morale by both speech  and magical blessings, scouting and preparing some pit traps alongside  some other magical traps, and checking some siege defense weapons the  night came in and the battle was about to begin. I like setting up many  Lovecraft like tension so i said a speech that was like ""you feel a  heavy pressure of stress, you see high up in the sky the shining stars  looking down on you like they were a great audience witnessing a great  long play in course"" adding some other scary and unnerving details that  they enjoyed a lot.

Without  warning a great flaming missile from a hellcannon crashed the walls, the  fighter eagerly mounted on his horse and started mobilizing the shock  cavalry to the side to prepare for an two flank ambush he discussed with  the royal knights of the lord of the city, the cleric casted her  striking spell (striking is a lvl 3 spell that adds 1d6 extra damage to  the targeted weapon) into one of the wall great ballista weapons,  specifically the one the thief was handling at first for shits and  giggles and took down a good chunk of a group of chaos marauders running  about while the Magic User was channeling a great wall of ice to halt  the initial waves for a while.

After  a great start with the initial plans of the players the rest of the  skirmish went very even, blood and fire going adrift under the beautiful  dark starry sky and a shining moon, the wind going fiercely caresing  the corpses and the bodies of those still fighting and runing, when the  players managed to get together they did some fighting against some  enemy groups and liteunants and randomly rolling some things like  miscelaneous magical items they werent able to use / they were saving  for another moment, the players survived many hardships and even some  one hit kill effects like choking dust among other things... There was  even a mirror fight because one of the chaos liteunants didn't had body  guards but a magical mirror that created chaos replicas of those  reflected making it for a very stressfull and hard fight.

After  a while of random battling in quick succession (thanks B/X D&amp;D for  being the edition with the fastest combat posible) some epic and funny  player interactions and seeing that the enemy breached the walls they  fought on the streets trying to save as many people as possible and  helping them leave through the back of the city. Then they reached the  huge cathedral of the sun, where a great chaos chariot was, and the one  who was there, was dark lord Covid himself with his Chaos Chosen  Bodyguards.

The form of the Dark  Lord himself was very strange to describe, he manifested as a creature  that took many forms, a black mass that was holding so much chaos energy  that it was an everchanging being, somehow still capable of holding  life itself despite the constant and violent state of chaos and change  that it was subjected to. The fighter with his great bretonnian honor  challenged the Dark Lord himself to a 1v1 duel inside of the cathedral  that was already being corrupted and darkened by his presence, with a  great evil laughter he accepts and magically shuts the door in front of  the other party members who start to fight the Chosen Chaos Warriors.

Fierce  strikes, swift spells, the cleric with her great magical armor tanking  and taking fierce blows while the thief was running away to make an  distraction and to find a good spot to help the others, the elf was  holding with a magical sword that he emanated with a scroll (hey that  rhymes) while the mage was blasting it with illusion spells and magic  missiles.

The fighter was rolling  20s like crazy, like the gods and the stars themselves were helping this  warrior of law that was facing a great peril, the others had an even  fight, but with some casualties, you see, in order to tell this part of  the story i need to clarify how initiatives work on B/X, every time a  round started both parties have to roll a D6 of initiative to determine  who manages to act first in the following 10 seconds of combat with the  respective order of action, first was moralle (for npc minions /  hirelings and enemies) then it was movement, then ranged attacks, then  magic phase and lastly melee phase, one little detail is, if both  parties roll the same number on the d6 both act at the same time in a  consecutive round.

With some bad  initiatives the cleric and the elf gave their lives holding the line,  the magic user in furious anger unleashed destructive AoE spells that  could have affected him if he was careless, ending up doing a suicide  bombing tactic mixing oil flasks that he had with a fireball taking down  the remaining chaos chosen with him, the thief was shooting from afar  but she got distracted when she saw a chaos mass of meat trying to eat  some children that were cornered and with a great backstab with the pick  she destroys it completely. The fighter and the Dark Lord rolled a  consecutive round being on the brink of death they both crit dealing the  maximun damage, both dying in the cathedral, the fighter with the dark  sword on his chest fell to the ground while watching the dark mass of  chaos revolving, changing, desintegrating and exploding in front of him  before he gave his last breath seeing the dark vanishing from the  cathedral.

After the Dark Lords  death the moon shined bright, everyone was able to see in the distance  the everchanging form of the lord of chaos that was dissipating and  abandoning this world under the great moon, making the warriors of chaos  flee back to their horrid wastes... Not only a battle, but the entire  war was won, but only one of the heroes remained to tell the story of  the great martyrs blessed by the flames of law, even if their characters  died they were satisfied with the result, knowing what was happened and  what was in stake, and from this idea im starting to create a campaign  about the restoration of the world of the Gaia and even an evil campaign  that serves as a prequel to this events.

TL  DR: Charity session where my players faced and defeated the great dark  lord Covid the 19th with some casualties making the dead PCs the great martyrs of law.",1

A bit of background. I am new to a lot of dungeon mastering and map creation, but I do have experience in Arma 3's Zeus mode which has a lot of similar characteristics. The island I am using as inspiration in fact is Tanoa from the Apex expansion if anyone has played that. As of right now all I have is a general shape of the island and a simple idea for it. I'd like to keep things tropical if I can. For my sake I am just gonna have these questions in a list.

* When working with a world map should I draw out topography
   * I already have squares marking 2D distance (1cm=100m) so how should I space my vertical measurements?
   * How do I mark waterfalls?
* How should I mark landmarks (caves, villages, bridges, jungles)? I was just gonna use the ones in Arma 3 and fallback on NATO map markers if I can't find something.
* What interesting land features should I put on the map?
* What kind of fauna should I have?
* Thoughts on more 'modern' factions on the island with AK-47s and such? (my party is okay with it, I just like bouncing ideas off of other people)
   * The consensus was that if there were firearms, that unless the players had firearm proficiency, they would not know how to use it properly and you would have to roll a 18 or higher to fire the gun correctly.
* Do people still like active volcanoes or is that overplayed?
* Dinosaurs y/n?
* A friend of mine wanted a flumph on the island, how should I make this monster's inclusion be more interesting than ""oh look there it is""?

I hope that this can help me put some much needed depth into the lore and life of the island as well as get me some experience with dungeon mastering in a game that isn't Arma! Any feedback is greatly appreciated and if you liked something in similar maps please let me know about it, I want this island to be cool as heck.

DnD,Jw029,0,"One of the best DnD experiences I've ever had (pt. 2) Alright, so I was originally planning to post this the day after I posted Part 1, but I totally forgot. So, without further ado, part 2 of one of the best DnD experiences I've ever had.

Characters

Duke (my character): A neutral good human monk played by yours truly.

Cross: A chaotic neutral human warlock played by my friend, O, and Duke's best friend in-game.

Ragonok: A lawful evil dragonborn paladin played by my friend, J.

Tomoki: A true neutral changeling rogue played by J's friend, N.

E: The dungeon master, and one of the most sadistic bastards I've ever met.

Unfortunately, our friend M (who you might remember as the guy who tossed me into a pack of giant rats) was unable to make it to the session, but it was also the session where Tomoki joined the party. Also, some background for those who either don't remember what happened in Part 1, or who skipped Part 1 entirely: the campaign we were playing was inspired by Dark Souls, and as such, souls were our currency and experience points, and each character had three ""Estus Flasks"" that they could drink to restore HP, and a downed player could be resurrected if their party members gave them the same amount of Flasks they were carrying when they died.

Okay, so E basically had us started the session with the three of us (Duke, Cross, and Ragonok) back at the tavern, now with 65 souls each, talking to the Guild Master, who was pretty pissed off that we busted down the door to the sewer in order to get in, and took off 50 souls from the reward he was gonna give us to pay for repairs. Naturally, we were pretty pissed.

Duke: I'm sorry, but I f**king *died* in that sewer. You ever get eaten alive by giant rats? It's pretty damn painful. If anything, you need to *raise* the reward.

Cross tried bargaining with him to raise the reward, but flubbed the roll and the Guild Master threatened to take even more, but ultimately didn't. Then, Tomoki went up to us and asked to join the party on their quest (although it was more of an errand, really), and we accepted her into the party. The Guild Master gave us a letter and told us to take it to the head of the sewage maintenance crew, who would then give us a key to get in the sewer.

Duke: Wait, they already repaired the door? Damn, that was fast.

E: No, dumbass, there's another door.

Well, we went over to the maintenance crew's HQ, and it smelled *rank* in there. Like, E literally described the smell as ""moldy cheese mixed with farts"" or something along those lines.

So anyway, we gave the letter to the guy, and Tomoki immediately tried explaining why we needed the key, but the guy stopped her.

Maintenance Crew Guy: Look, I really don't need any context. This letter just says, ""Give these idiots a key to the sewers.""

Duke: As time goes on, the idea of putting that snobby Guild Master six feet under just gets more and more appealing.

So we got the key, and decided to buy some supplies from the local market before we went into the sewers. We got to the market, and Tomoki immediately bought two scented candles (to make the trip through the sewers more bearable) for four souls. Keep that in mind, cuz it's important later. I managed to buy a rapier (which is a martial weapon, something I'm proficient in using), and we bought a couple more items before we made it to a vendor who was selling mirrors. Strangely enough, E spent a lot of time describing this guy's clothes. He was wearing a yellow shirt with a blue stripe across the chest, leather fingerless gloves, and a straw hat. That's how we were able to figure out that this guy would somehow be important later.

Tomoki walked up to the vendor and started bartering with him. At first, she tried trading in a crossbow for a mirror, but he refused, saying something that we all found quite creepy.

Mirror Vendor: I dunno, don't you have, uh, 61 souls left?

Keep in mind, this was spot-on, as Tomoki started out with 65 and spent four on scented candles. Eventually, we all got to the Mirror Vendor, and we all got the feeling something was off about him, but we couldn't quite figure out what that something was. At first, we thought he was a demon, but then Ragonok asked him to pass a mirror in a silver frame, and he touched it without it burning him. Ragonok tried rolling an Arcana Check on the mirror, but couldn't see anything magical. He asked the Vendor if there was anything special about the mirror, but the Vendor just said it was from some desert that I can't remember the name of for the life of me, which was apparently famous for having really pretty sand that could be used to make really pretty mirrors.

Naturally, I just knew something was off about this guy, so I rolled a Perception Check. Here's the thing though: even though I rolled an 18, E said that I just got an uneasy feeling and nothing more. That means I probably would've needed to roll a Nat 20 to pick up on anything. The Vendor also noticed that I was looking at him.

Mirror Vendor: Somethin' wrong?

Duke: No... just lookin' around.

I then decided to ask him how he knew the exact amount of souls Tomoki was carrying, to which he responded thusly:

Mirror Vendor: Oh, y'know, ya play the game long enough, you pick up on a few tricks.

I knew something was wrong with that answer, but I didn't press any further. After Ragonok bought the mirror from earlier, we decided to leave. But before we could, the Vendor asked a favor of us.

Mirror Vendor: Y'know, there's a rumour that there's a cockatrice roaming those sewers. If you could, I'd like ya to bring me its skull.

Cross: Any particular reason?

Mirror Vendor: I got a friend in town who specializes in taxidermy. He's always wanted a cockatrice skull.

That's when *I* realized that a cockatrice kills with its glare, so it could easily be killed by a mirror. However, E then said that in *his* campaign, cockatrices actually do something different, but he wasn't going to reveal anything just yet.

Well, I don't want this post to be too long, so make sure to stay tuned for Part 3, which will detail the second half of our session. Peace!",1

me; the DM

story: so my players were exploring a mountain range when they came across what looked like a rundown shack. they walked into the village when suddenly a force field appeared behind them and they were trapped in the village.

henry tried to cast a spell and it turned into magic missile, yep they were in a wild magic zone. this went on for a while with them not able to break the barrier. 

an hour passes and they finally decide to head into the village. there they find a small scared halfling child in a small rundown shack. they start interrogating him and he tells them that shadowy beasts attacked the village destroying it and setting up a force field and wild magic zone. john then rolled for history on the force field and gets a 19. I proceed to tell him that his hexblade was the one that cursed the village and attacked as a punishment for one of their members had broken a pact with it.

they then talk to the hexblade and the hexblade tells them that he will only open the force field if everyone of the village members are dead soooooo. 

they killed the kid.

TL;DR group finds themselves stuck in an abandoned town that is a wild magic zone, insanity ensues. finds out johns patron was the one that cursed the town, and they kill a kid.",1

DnD,morgana_le_bae,14,"In over my head  

This is the first ever campaign that i'm DMing (its in 5e). Everything was going swell, and they were (usually) following the story line i set up. but then party went through a portal to another plane (i'm currently deciding if it's Plane of Shadow or Shadowfell) and i'm just not sure how to continue the story.

a quick run down:

healer turned to necromancer, worshiping Shar, and formed an alliance with a Reaper. She then went on to harass the town that originally killed her by creating bone faeries. The party was sent in to deal with the fae, found out there was a bigger scheme of things and would not leave the portal alone, so i sent them through it.

as the title states, i'm in over my head. I thought i would be able to come up with the next part of the game, but i'm at a loss. any advice (outside of throwing the campaign out the window because they've really enjoyed it so far) would be very helpful.",1

The first problem is I'm not a very social person and I got a short attention span. My mind tends to wander and lose interest when there are long stretches of nothing happening and that's a problem in a DND game.

The second problem is that I work on the weekends(Or at least I did before COVID came in but thankfully once things settle down I can probably go back to work at the same place) and that's when most people tend to play DND.

The third problem is more of a personal thing. I've tried playing DND twice in the past and I didn't synergize well with either group. I ended up leaving both through a combination of my own accord and being pseudo kicked out.

Lately with no work and just killing time till things get better and I can go back part of me wants to give DND another try but I'm scared. I failed twice, once was with a close friend of mine, I don't know if this game is cut out for me. But I wanna try but I'm just...scared of putting myself out there without backup. I tried reasking if I could rejoin my friend's group but he was the one who told me I didn't synergize with the rest of them...

I really don't know what to do... How do I find the right DND group for me? or am I just not cut out for this game despite my love of it?",1

DnD,janimationd,11,"According to 5E math, some real-life humans have a Strength score of 209! I've been brushing up on 5E rules for an upcoming campaign, and figured it might be fun to work backwards from the real-life world records for physical feats to see what Strength scores some humans have been able to reach. I 100% understand that these comparisons mean very little, but they're still fun to consider.

For the purposes of these calculations I'm using the following formula for converting between strength score and modifier: **MOD = (SCORE - 10) / 2**

# Standing long jump
[World record:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_long_jump) 3.73m/12.2ft held by American Football cornerback Byron Jones

5E formula (in feet): X = (Strength score) / 2

Formula to determine STR score: Strength score = 2X

Effective Strength score: **24.4**


# Running long jump
[World record:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump#Records) 8.95m/29.4ft held by Olympic athlete Mike Powell

5E formula (in feet): X = Strength score

Formula to determine STR score: Strength score = X

Effective Strength score: **29.4**

*(note that the 5E rules specify you need only move 10 feet first to achieve a running long jump, while these athletes use a lot more than 10 feet to get up to speed; also these athletes would be landing prone while I believe the assumption in 5E is that you land standing up)*

# Standing high jump
[World record:](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-standing-jump?fb_comment_id=808261362548466_922377777803490) 1.65m/5.41ft held by college athlete Brett Williams

5E formula (in feet): X = (3 + (Strength score - 10) / 2) / 2

Formula to determine STR score: Strength score = (2X - 3) * 2 + 10 

Effective Strength score: **25.6**


# Running high jump
[World record:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_jump) 2.54m/8.33ft held by Olympic athlete Javier Sotomayer

5E formula (in feet): X = 3 + (Strength score - 10) / 2

Formula to determine STR score: Strength score = (X - 3) * 2 + 10

Effective Strength score: **20.66**

*(note that the 5E rules specify you need only move 10 feet first to achieve a running long jump, while these athletes use a lot more than 10 feet to get up to speed; also these athletes would be landing prone while I believe the assumption in 5E is that you land standing up)*

# Weight lift
[World record:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anderson_\(weightlifter\)) 2,840kg/6,270lb held by Olympic athlete Paul Anderson (lifted using back; slightly, briefly raised weights off ground; unofficial record)

5E formula (in pounds for medium creature): X = 30 * Strength score

Formula to determine STR score: Strength score = X / 30

Effective Strength score: **209** (!!?!?!?)

# Bonus: speed!
A bonus calculation along the same vein is the creature speed of the fastest human. [Olympic athlete Usain Bolt holds the world record human sprint speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footspeed#Limits_of_speed) of 44.72 km/h (27.78 mph) over 20 meters of a 100m race (average for the race was 37.58 km/h or 23.35 mph). If we use the race average speed, and assume he was able to use full movement, the dash action, and a bonus action dash from some class trait (I think this is a given because of all the training over the course of his life), then the math is as follows:

* 37.58 km/h = 34.25 ft/s
* 1 round = 6 seconds
* distance/round = 205.5
* distance/movement action (we said above he had 3 effective movement actions) = **68.5 ft**

In conclusion, **68.5 ft** is the fastest recorded human speed (by D&amp;D standards assuming 3 movements/round). [Now compare that to what's achievable in D&amp;D with magic...](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/58645)",1

DnD,HynraFoo,6,"[OC] This a journal prop I put together for my game. The players loved it! The album of pictures is here... 

https://imgur.com/a/ZXhhGwW

This took weeks of prep. First I wrote the journal in word; 35-B4 size pages of text. Each page has a secret ot important piece of information on it. There are codes and ciphers, prophesies and even hidden maps in the cover page.

The 2nd step was making it look hand written. I used a website that I won't promote in an open forum, but really was brilliant. The program inserts mistakes and varied characters into your text and varies the height of the characters in the line. There's a cost, but it was worth it. If you are interested I'll PM you the website.

Then pictures, and into a publisher document. Add in other notes and various images and... print. 

I Soaked each page in a tea/coffee blend and dry on a clothes dryer.

I learned how to stitch a book by hand and only had to restart once. Put the secret maps into the binding and... voila!

Lots of painstaking work, but I think it was worth it.

**Context:**

Creating D&amp;D characters is as therapeutic for me as it is fun and I‚Äôve decided to share some of them in hopes that someone else might try playing them or get some inspiration for their own characters. The characters I make aren‚Äôt really made for any one specific setting and I give myself a lot of freedom when it comes to what source books I use as I usually come up with more characters than I am able to play.

Any character I create has been made with solely the idea in mind that they might be a fun and/or interesting character to play. Because of this, most of them aren‚Äôt really made to be overly powerful, so if you‚Äôre looking for a guide on how to make the optimal build or just a plain strong build, this probably won‚Äôt be for you. 

I will make sure to include a link to my drive where you can see the full backstory and more detailed build guide for the character.

**The build at level 20:**

Gear is a Warforged monk of the way of the astral self who‚Äôs multiclassed into an echo knight fighter. The focus of his character is to use a barrage of attacks with the arms of the astral self to get in as many hits as possible in the shortest period of time. The fighter‚Äôs  action surge and echo knight abilities combined with all of the additional attacks the arms of the astral self and the complete astral self abilities grant can create for a scenario where you can pull off up to 11d10 of damage if all of your attacks hit. Afterwards, you can still keep dealing a consistent amount of up to 7d10 damage per turn if you optimise your KI consumption. 

**The story:**

In short, Gear was rescued by Warforged monks who were led by a Warforged named Krono. Krono is considered the master of their monastery as he has made everyone believe that he is the first Warforged to have achieved mastery of KI. This, combined with his made up legendary feat of stopping a lightning rail with a single punch has allowed him to amass many followers. 

As a follower of Krono, Gear firmly believed in his teachings and trough his training was able to truly come into contact with his KI and decided to show this to Krono who, in turn, sent Gear on an impossible quest as he believed that his newfound abilities might be a threat to Krono‚Äôs plans.

Parts of the story are purposefully left out so as to allow a potential DMs and players to expand on it how they see fit.

DnD,Veinscrawler,23,"Running a Campaign for Players In Different Time Zones - Help? First time posting. I‚Äôll probably delete this later. It‚Äôs a long one, because providing extraneous detail is my thing. Sorry, in advance. TL;DR at bottom.

**Background**
I am currently acting as a DM for a DnD 5e campaign that is being played through Discord. I have never run a proper campaign for multiple people before. I agreed to this after my romantic partner (knowing that I have wanted to run a tabletop rpg campaign for many years) created a Discord server for DnD, invited a bunch of people he somewhat knew, and asked me to be the DM.

None of the players are people I know personally. They are all online friends or online acquaintances of my partner. Some are even online friends of those other online friends who even my partner doesn‚Äôt know at all. Most if not all of them are younger than my partner and I. As far as I know, all of them are currently in school and very busy with classes, homework, and studying for exams.

DnD 5e is actually not my system of choice (despite the fact that I own hardback copies and PDFs of all of the 5e books). The players wanted to play DnD 5e because a few of them are familiar with it and play in other 5e campaigns. I‚Äôm familiar with the system, so I‚Äôm fine with that. Some of the players have never played a tabletop rpg before, and this is their introduction to DnD 5e. That‚Äôs also fine with me.

Not all of the 20+ people who joined the Discord server have actually become players, but in total there are currently 7 or 8 people who have made a character and played in an adventure. It is possible that more people will continue to join the game over time. 

Since it is a largish group of players and everyone has different availability, I decided to scrap any ideas of running a campaign of my own design and instead run the Season 1 storyline of Adventurer‚Äôs League. My reasoning was that Adventurer‚Äôs League adventures are 1. very goal-oriented (to keep people on track), 2. relatively short (to ensure that people can finish the adventures in limited time), and 3. very modular (to enable players to play on different days while still participating in the same story).

It hasn‚Äôt been entirely unsuccessful. Fun has definitely been had. But two major problems came up almost immediately: scheduling and session length.

**Scheduling Issues**
Currently, every single player lives in a different time zone from the rest. One player lives in UTC -7, another lives in UTC -4, lives in UTC +2, another lives in UTC +10, etcetera. I made a spreadsheet just to keep track of all of the time zones involved.

They also all have different availability on weekdays and weekends. My partner can‚Äôt ever play on weekends because of his job, and I also have obligations that take up a good chunk of my Sunday. Most of the other players are only semi-consistently available on Saturdays and Sundays (and not both, in some cases).

Needless to say, this has made made scheduling exceedingly difficult. It is literally impossible for all of the players to play at the same time on the same day. And everyone has basically said that 3 players is the minimum they will play with. 

Often what happens is that I am available to DM and 2 players want to play, but we aren‚Äôt able to get a third player, so it doesn‚Äôt happen. And even when we can get a group of 3 or 4 together, players often can‚Äôt play for a significant amount of time before it gets too late for them to continue. 

Now that most of them are busy with exams, we actually haven‚Äôt played for two weeks. Which under normal circumstances might not seem like too long, except the last session only involved 3 players, so it has been even longer for the rest of them.

**Session Length Issues**
Altogether, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve run maybe 25 hours of DnD for this group (not counting time spent on stuff done in between ‚Äúsessions‚Äù, which would just about double that estimate). But so far, we have only gotten through DDAL-1-1 ‚ÄúDefiance in Phlan.‚Äù The five mini-missions that are meant to be played in 1 hour each, for 5 hours total.

Not only has it taken 3+ hours to finish each of the 1-hour mini-missions, but there was only 1 adventure where all of the players who started the adventure were still playing at the end of the adventure. This is because some of the players can‚Äôt play for more than 2 hours at a time (and sometimes not even that - one player dropped out after realizing that it would take more than 1 hour to finish a session). 

For example: The first ‚Äúmission‚Äù we finished started with 4 players. Then another player joined. Then one of the original characters died. Then one of the original players had to leave. Then the player who joined late had to leave. So there were only 2 characters left. So we waited until another player could join, and then those 3 players finished the adventure.

Not that this is not for lack of trying on anyone‚Äôs part. Personally, I always feel like I‚Äôm really pressuring everyone to think quickly and trying to rush things along so that we can finish before someone has to drop out. Which I hate doing, and has led to stuff like conversations with NPCs being very short and often lacking detail.

Factors I‚Äôve noticed that slow the game down: 
- players not being able to hear each other over game chat and needing to repeat what they said
- a couple times someone had difficulty visualizing what was happening (we use mostly theatre of the mind because I can‚Äôt share my screen to show a map)
- some players prefer typing while others prefer speaking, which means two players are often trying to ‚Äútalk‚Äù at the same time (plus typing takes longer)
- players talking about stuff unrelated to the game at hand (which would normally be fine, but limited time, so...)
- players having difficulty deciding what to do, getting stuck in disagreements over planning, etc.
- players wanting to do things unrelated to the mission (again, normally fine, but...)

Even then, I still can‚Äôt figure out where all the time is going. But again, it wouldn‚Äôt normally be an issue. I‚Äôm used to playing 4-5 hour sessions in games. 

Except the players in this game have limited availability and can‚Äôt stay long. And because of time zones and differing schedules, it‚Äôs usually impossible to get the same group back together to finish the adventure if we have to do another session of it. And everyone seems to feel it‚Äôs awkward when people have to join in midway.

**Attempted Fixes**
I tried adding in downtime activities to allow characters to get to do all the things their players want to do that there isn‚Äôt time for during sessions (like gambling and heists and buying stuff and interacting with NPCs). 

I‚Äôm not being strict with it either. Characters only have downtime and lifestyle expenses after an adventure - there‚Äôs no bookkeeping for characters who didn‚Äôt participate. And anyone can just rest and do nothing else by default. I was hoping this would allow more focus on adventuring during adventures.

But I‚Äôm starting to think that this has led to a new issue where players are telling me they want their character to do something for downtime (not just rest), but they‚Äôre not able to make the time to actually do it or able to decide how to proceed based on the results. And I end up reaching out multiple times to ask what they‚Äôve decided on and when they can do it. Which I hate doing, because it feels like badgering. I‚Äôm worried that downtime is going to start to feel like a chore, which is the exact opposite of what I intended it to be.

It‚Äôs also led to a weird thing where it feels like most of the plot developments and interactions that players care about are actually happening ‚Äúoff-screen‚Äù during downtime, because there‚Äôs no time to go into detail during adventures.

I also write session reports of every adventure and every downtime session, so that players can see what happened in each other‚Äôs adventures or in their own adventure if they had to leave early. The purpose is to help them stay engaged in the larger plot. 

But it takes a long time to do that, in order to keep in all of the relevant details other characters need to know. And even then, there have been multiple times where players missed something they cared about, either because they weren‚Äôt in the earlier adventure to make the connection or they were but they fell asleep or left early and missed the relevant info.

**Final Thoughts**
Altogether, I really hate the direction things are going in, but I have no idea how to fix any of it. I don‚Äôt like running ‚ÄúDnD lite‚Äù where the plot is in the background and characters are forced together by the conceit of the adventure of the day. I want to run a game where the players can choose what to do instead of having the plot handed to them each time. 

But I also know that, based on the amount of time it takes us to do a 1-hour railroad adventure, nothing would ever get done if I stopped using the AL adventures to give an obvious direction to go in. And yet I'm worried that we won't be able to get through one of the 4-hour (or gods forbid, 8-hour) adventures in a reasonable amount of time and without players dropping in and out like crazy.

I've brought up the idea of switching to something more freeform, like a megadungeon or a West Marches-style game, something where there's just a basic overarching goal and characters can even more easily pop in and out. But most of the players have said they don't want that and that they want to continue the current game with more plot. And play by post is not an option.

So... any suggestions on what I should do?

**TL;DR**
DMing DnD 5e through Discord game chat. Group of 8 players who all live in different timezones, have varied schedules, and can only play for relatively short periods of time. Impossible for everyone to play on the same day. Sessions take too long: took 20+ hours to finish a 5-hour Adventurer's League adventure. Players still don't get to do a lot of the stuff they want to. Adding downtime hasn't really helped much. Plot is disjointed due to players being in different groups every time. Writing sessions logs hasn't helped much. Players don't want to switch to something else. What do?

I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to actually read this all and give me some advice. Love you guys :) 

Anyway so around Christmas time I got invited to a homebrew campaign being DMed by a friend of my friend who I hadn‚Äôt really spoken to until he asked me if I wanted to play. Being quite new to DnD and absolutely loving it I of course accepted.

Then because of school and stuff I never really met with him or anyone to discuss my character or anything but he basically gave me some information about the campaign setting and stuff like that and gave me free reign for what I wanted to play and my backstory and stuff.

Now because I had played a warlock for a few sessions in another campaign and was enjoying that I decided I wanted to do that for this campaign as well and so I thought about a hexblade as it seemed very interesting and I wanted to try a melee combatant while still having spells (which is what I LOVE about dnd) so I picked that and came up with a very tragic and painful backstory to try and keep to the edgy theme of his class.

Then we did like 3 sessions with about 1 or 2 people out of the (I think) 8 person party and everything was ok, just kind of low level mini dungeons and stuff and I was like cool this is ok.
And then during lockdown we‚Äôve been doing more full (online) sessions with full party and stuff and it just kind of flipped everything

I think one of the main reasons I‚Äôm struggling with the character is that it has become a very role play heavy campaign which is something I‚Äôm not good at because I‚Äôve only been playing since like last September and the other campaign is VERY combat heavy. And I‚Äôve just realised I don‚Äôt like playing the like edgy and dark characters and it really pisses me off because I feel like I‚Äôm not doing my character justice and I really don‚Äôt know what to do about it, I just know that I‚Äôd be at least a bit better at role playing a more quirky and jokey guy because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm playing him now and I‚Äôm just kind of failing at being the ominous and intimidating dark arts user.

I also feel quite useless in the few combat encounters we‚Äôve had because I just think our party is already very melee based and I think I‚Äôd be more useful playing a more ranged and supporting caster role but we already have a cleric (our only spell caster) so idk. ( But that could be because we r quite low levelled so obviously I‚Äôm not gonna be doing that much in battle)

I also feel really awkward talking to him about it because I get very anxious with people I don‚Äôt know too well and I feel like it‚Äôs too late for me to back out and ask to re roll a new character. Especially because he has made effort to include my character in the storyline with like dreams with plot hooks and a couple special homebrew features and stuff as rewards for challenges so it feels really douchey to just kind of throw that all back in his face. 

Anyway tysm for reading this the whole way through and yeah I‚Äôd really appreciate any help guidance with what to do",1

**Amenruta‚Äôs Hand of Glory**

*The dry, pickled hand of Amenruta. It is closed in a tight fist, impossible to open.*

\- The Hand of Glory stores up to 3 charges. Any character wielding The Hand can spend an action to use either one, two, or three charges at once. The Hand replenishes all spent charges at dawn.

**1 charge** 

*The Hand of Glory opens its fist to reveal a white wax candle. The Hand closes once the candle is removed.*

If the candle is lit, the flame will take on a shimmering blue colour, and will not produce heat.

The light is only visible to the holder. It lasts for 1 hour, providing bright light for 30 feet and dim light for an additional 20.

**2 charges** 

*The Hand of Glory opens its fist to reveal a simple key, with an eye etched into the end. The Hand closes once the key is removed or dissipates.*

The key will crumble to dust 10 minutes after it is revealed by the hand.

If the key is pressed onto or put into any non-magically sealed lock, it will transform both shape and size into a copy of the key for that lock. It cannot transform back to its original shape or into another key after this.

**3 charges**

*The Hand of Glory opens its fist and points its empty palm in a direction of your choosing, filling your enemies‚Äô heads with visions of their deepest fears.*

All creatures in a 15-foot cone starting from your position must make a DC 15 wisdom save. If they fail, they take 2d6 psychic damage and are struck by fear of you for 1 minute. If they succeed, they take half damage and are not frightened.

A creature who is fearful of you must spend their entire movement running away from you on their turn. At the end of their turn they can make a new DC15 wisdom saving throw to end the effect early.

**When the last charge is spent**

*The Hand of Glory‚Äôs palm remains open and turns to face you. A voice speaks incoherently in your head, filling all possible silence with deafening whispers.*

The person who used the last charge of The Hand must make a DC15 wisdom save to block out the whispers. If they fail, they become afflicted with Madness.

**GM notes:**

The Madness from the ‚Äúlast charge‚Äù effect is a Short-term madness.

With Detect Magic, the hand emits a healthy mix of conjuration and enchantment magic, all coated in a nasty ‚Äúfilm‚Äù of necromantic magic. The Candle emits Conjuration magic. The Key emits Transmutation magic.

When under the effect of the last charge spent, a character can try to hear what the whispers say. If they know Abyssal, they can roll a clean intelligence check to try to decipher the overlapping and intertwining whispers.

The whispers are all along the lines of

*‚ÄúCan you trust your companions?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI think he/she just glanced at you‚Äù*

*‚ÄúNo one is safe‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou should just give up‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYour life is meaningless‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWe all die‚Äù*

Make them up! Just keep the tone bleak and generally unsupportive.",1

DnD,EverythingArcane,6,"Star vs the Forces of Evil characters in D&amp;D For those of you familiar with the show I was curious about your opinions on converting it's characters into D&amp;D 5e. Given the high fantasy element of it I thought it would be really fun. Here's what I have for Tom, Star, and Marco. Please give me your opinions and feel free to add info on other characters, I'm interested. 

Pretty self explanatory. What class and race do you think the characters would be in D&amp;D 5e, subclass and subrace included. Also alignment. Here's mine for a few

Star Butterfly: Wizard of Conjuration, Protector Aasimar. Chaotic Good. So first, wizard. Why I'm leaning torwards star as a wizard is because she has a spellbook. That's mostly it. Yeah, she does cast spells without either that or her wand later in the show, but those are only the ones she knows, which is exactly what happens if a wizard loses their spellbook. They can only cast prepared spells. As far as conjuration, many of her spells involve summoning creatures like narwhals or spider. Also later she can open portals. For Protector Aasimar, I went with Aasimar over human because Star does have the whole butterfly form, and an angel advisor which could be glossaryk. Finally for alignment, Chaotic Good seems about right. She is sure as hell not Lawful, that's one of her big things. She's too impulsive to follow rules and actively strives against tradition. Later in the show she does mature a little bit, but she is still flighty and doesn't have her priorities completely straight (See the pig scene). As far as Good vs. Evil, well she is definitely not evil. I don't think she's quite neutral though, she cares too much about the good of all. So, Chaotic Good.

Tom Lucitor: Tiefling of Mephistopheles, Warlock with a Fiend Pact. Chaotic Neutral. This is pretty self explanatory. He's the demon prince of hell, what else is he good be. Sorcerer maybe, but there's no truly fire-centric classes. As far as Chaotic Neutral, I think him being Chaotic is pretty obvious. He constantly tries to distract star, gets upset when it doesn't work,  and really just does what he wants. He is wholly dedicated to star as seen when he builds an entire carriage, so I think he is on the border between Chaotic and True Neutral. As far as Good vs. Evil, he's as Neutral as it gets. He certainly isn't evil; he isn't sadistic or manipulative. But he's not Good, as he owns slaves and if he were good he'd treat them with more than indifference. Also those things that he does do that are good are almost always to protect someone he does like, not because of any inherent morality

Marco Diaz: Human, Champion Fighter, Lawful Good. Marco is a human. He has no magic without express assistance whatsoever and is okayish at pretty much everything. Now the reason I chose Fighter over monk is because monks have Ki, which is a type of magic,  non-traditional as it may be. If he was a monk it would probably be the way of the open hand as it's the closest to pure martial arts, but there are still significant supernatural abilities. Fighter is just that, a mundane fighter. Which is what marco is, and ordinary dude that's really good at fighting. There's no spiritualism involved. Yes there is the whole honor and duty thing he finds important but that doesn't give him any special abilities like it does a monk. Finally we have alignment. Honestly I think Marco is the most far spread across LG, NG, LN, and N but ultimately I think he's Lawful Good, albeit barely. As far as lawful, he is the safe kid and he seems to have a distinct code he goes by. Him being Good was a little bit easier, but it was still not an easy descision at all. But he is the most dedicated against evil over almost any other character. I mean he's the one who shows star how monsters are unfairly treated.",1

Hi guys, I‚Äôm currently hosting my first dungeons and dragons session as a DM and decided to make it Disney theme. I‚Äôve seen a few threads of this being done in the past but I thought I‚Äôd give it a go myself!

The general theme is that Lightning McQueen (magic-user), Edna Mode (Assassin/thief) Quasimodo (Fighter) and Fix-It-Felix (cleric) have grouped up to defeat an evil that has taken over the world. Mickey Mouse has asked them to collect 5 sacred stones guarded by Disney villains hidden in a dungeon. Once all 5 are found they can then defeat the evil.

So far we have played one module and the modules are as followed:

Module 1: Pirates of the Caribbean and underwater kingdom guarded by Ursula (Level 1-3)
Module 2: Savannah and Jungle themed guarded by King Louis and Scar (Levels 3-5)
Module 3: Alice in Wonderland (level 5-7, but not sure what to include)
Module 4: Not sure yet (level 7-9)
Module 5: Monsters inc. and Pixar, guarded by Mike Wazowksi beholder (level 9-11)

I was wondering what DMs would so with a character that is hurt coming in from the start?  I know I am legit totally hindered by these injuries but this isn't a total fantasy world.like we play in.

DnD,Bluey59223,16,"Why are the monstrous player races so different from the actual monsters they're based on? I was looking at some monster stat blocks earlier and noticed that bugbears (as a monster) get the brute feature, which makes it so that their weapon attacks deal one extra damage die of the appropriate type, but the playable bugbear race doesn't get that.

Then I searched for more continuity errors and realized that the monster bugbears only have a reach of 5 feet with their weapon attacks, but the playable race gets a reach boost of 5 feet, meaning they'll usually have a reach of 10 feet with their weapon attacks. In addition, monster bugbears don't get the surprise attack feature.

Hobgoblins (as a monster) get martial advantage, but the playable race has saving face instead of that. 

Regular goblins don't have fury of the small, but the player race does.

The kobold race gets grovel, cower, and beg, but the monster version doesn't have that.

The monster yuan-ti pureblood can cast suggestion and poison spray 3 times per day but the playable race can do poison spray at will and only gets suggestion once per long rest.

Is there any reason for all of these discrepancies? Did WotC just forget about all of this stuff?",1
DnD,OutIooks,26,"Magic Absorption/Stealing There's already a spell to absorb magical attacks and use them to power your own, but is there a way to permanently drain magic from a person or object? If so, I intend to incorporate this into a later game boss. It would steal or absorb all magic in order to use devastating attacks, and disable all magic that could be used against it. I'm also debating giving said creature a non solid body, making melee attacks very ineffective. But does any of this exist? If not, would any of it be possible? And permanent drainage might be replaced with suppression. Making basic magic actions incredibly difficult. But let me know on this, I'm interested to hear what you all think.
EDIT: I tend to post my thoughts in their entirety. Some things will be removed or altered. In this post specifically, the non solid body will be removed most likely. I'm likely gonna take that away and just have it be focused on using magic and crippling magic users, leaving melee the only option.",1

I recently joined a game where, as the title implies, spells and magical effects are doubled. This means everything from range, damage, bonuses, penalties, and just about anything with a numerical value in the description. I rolled up a monk because I had never played one before, but I'm worried that I'll fall WAY behind in terms of DPR and utility.

In campaigns such as this, how broken (or not) is it to double the effects of spells? I know there's already a power divide between casters and martial classes, it feels as though this would only exponentially widen that divide.",1

Catacomb complex in which some bodies were intentionaly made into zombies, which lay dormant, and only attack anybody who would disturb the eternal peace of the dead. At some point, the same civilisation that build that came upon an artifact, and wanted to get rid of it, but couldn't. So a group of brave adventurers took it there, sealed the catacombs from within, filled it with traps, and made oath to not let the artifact be taken away. And so, they are there ever since.

Now, milenia later, the whole story is forgotten. The PCs are send to retrieve the artifact from the sealed tomb. They do not know hwat it is, they simply have description and promise of good reward if they bring it to the questgiver. 

Anyway, I though it might be cool to have one of the eternal guardians have their mental faculties still present somewhat, and try to make the PCs go away, rather then fight with them. The puzzle being how to actually communicate, since... well, you know... it's been milenia. There is kind of language barrier. And no PC has ""comprehend languages""...

Now, I love my friends, but I often find myself a bit frustrated with how they handle the game. I don't want to sound like a buzzkill, but they never take anything in the game seriously, even after I have asked them to take the game a bit more seriously.  


I don't mean to say that I want everything to be gritty and realistic, but I would like them to get in the game and roleplay seriously. The biggest problem, I think, is that the party usually consists of nothing but joke characters. For example, a few characters were a monkey who can't speak/isn't even really sentient, a warforged who the player intentionally gave him a one in all stats making him literally useless, (Btw, yes, I asked him to change his character, but he refused.) Ronald Mcdonald, and Solid Snake, who is just an actual snake. These characters obviously cause a few issues in trying to run the game, specifically in the roleplaying department.

I have asked the players to make serious characters, and have even refused some characters outright. However, after I refuse the characters, they usually do one of two things

1. Make another joke character who is even less suited for roleplaying
2. They pull the, ""It's the GM's job to adapt to the player's actions"" card, and tell me that it's my job to allow them to play the characters they want.

I really don't know what to do, should I just stop being a bitch and cater to their joke characters? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1

So the Abuderation Wizard has an ability called Arcane Ward. In the PHB it states ‚ÄúWhen you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell‚Äôs magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has a hit point maximum equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier."" followed by ""Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.""

So this in its own right, This makes you tanker then almost any other wizard but it doesn‚Äôt stop there. The Warlock can break this ability well. The ability I‚Äôm talking about is the Eldtrich invocation, Armor of Shadows

According to the PHB, it states ‚ÄúArmor of Shadows:
You can cast Mage Armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components‚Äù.

Use maps found online and only the DM can move the assets based on what people want.

In short, they have climbers kits and are planning to scale the bridge that's said to be \~1000ft high. They're new players and are finding their voice still so I wanted something light and easy for this. I obviously don't want them to die here of all places but they know it's a big task so I'm not gonna hand wave it either.

When they get at the base of the Bridge they're given a turn to say how they each prepare. I want  them to *maybe* select the best/most innovative/most useful idea and nominate that person to have advantage on their role for scaling the bridge. Everyone will roll individually. I plan to sandwich good-bad-good rolls for them and go around in turn order determined that way and have them narrate their ascent with a general reminder to think of an obstacle the group might have to overcome and how their action affects the person beneath.

I was about to get back into DMing a 5e game and was curious about how others prepare for their games. I feel like more often than not, I will prep stuff that is either not used or non prep enough for what is happening. Not that I am scared of improv, but I like to have more things established and thought out to fit better in the world/narrative. 

Something I would like to address with my prep is that my players will usually always go for the path of least resistance first or take the first option I give them, which is fine of course. However, I would still like to challenge them to think a bit more about their actions in a meaningful narrative way and also more strategic/puzzle solving way without just putting spike pits and bandits around them 24/7.

Tangent aside, I would love to hear more about how each of you prep for your sessions and maybe if someone is feeling adventurous, I could see some example prep work: notes, dm screens or something of the like?

Being that the house would be regarded as a mass of multiple objects, would I be assuming the spell does not damage the house, but damages the door, the windows, each brick in the walls, every piece of furniture, etc individually?

* **Devils + Demons**: These creatures test to be spirits or creatures from another place, that seek to cause harm. They may go by many names, but can generally put into the bucket of ""evil creature or evil spirit"".
* **Fey/Sylvan**: They are the fairy creatures. Elves, Pixies, Sprites, Fairies, Brownies, Hobgoblins, Kobolds, and the like. Lesser spirits that cause mischief (though they can be dangerous), these are generally of northern European mythology, though they are often grouped with Sylvan creatures such as centaur, satyrs, and other 'nature' spirits like dryads and sylphs of Greek mythology.
* **Chimeras**: Another very common bucket, Chimeras are combinations of different creatures. This can be a mix of man and beast (Sphynx, Centaur, Merman) or a mix of various beasts (Griffin, Dragon, Kirin)
* **Undead:** Tales of the undead often cross with the ""evil spirits"" of the devil/demon bucket, but these tend to be the spirits of the once living, vs. spirits of non-human origin.
* **Literature Based**: Many monsters are based on creatures in literature, not folklore or mythology.
* **Invented**: Creatures simply made up for D&amp;D
* **""Word of Mouth"" / ""Telephone Game"":** These creatures are real creatures, that through indirect description became mystical creatures of mythology. Creatures such as the Behemoth (Hippopotomus), Catoblepas (Wildebeast), Baku (Tapir) were all real animals, but as the description traveled it became less and less acurate, until the creature being described was it's own ""thing"" and took on a life of its own.

While these don't cover all the creatures, it's an interesting observation of where creatures come from and made their way to D&amp;D. With that, we can get to the next batch of creatures...

# Origins of Monsters - D

**Daemon**

*Etymology*: Greek *daimon* (‚Äúgod, power, fate‚Äù), from PIE \**daimon* (‚Äúprovider, divider of fortune‚Äù), possibly from \**da-* (‚Äúto divide, to allot‚Äù)

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

*Origin*: In Greek mythology, daemons are benevolent spirits. They were broken into two groups; agathodaemon (noble spirit, from *agathos* (‚Äúgood/brave‚Äù)) and *kakoda√≠m≈çn* (from *kak√≥s* (‚Äúbad/evil‚Äù)). Generally, they were similar to Arabic Jinn and Roman genius. The D&amp;D daemons are closer to the judeo-christian demons of the middle ages, likely inspired by Dante Allegri and other period art. The following Daemons appeared in AD&amp;D

**Demons**

*Etymology*: English *demon* (‚Äúevil spirit, servant of the devil‚Äù), from Latin *daem≈çn* (‚Äúfamiliar spirit, guardian spirit‚Äù), from Greek *da√≠m≈çn* (‚Äúprotective spirit‚Äù)

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual (1977)

*Origin*: Demon refers to different creatures, depending on the time period. The modern usage of the word refers to evil spirits and servants of hell. In Roman and Greek times, a demon was a protective or guardian spirit, that might inhabit a particular location (such as a house spirit) or to a person‚Äôs inner spirit (compare to Latin *genius*). When the region was converted to Christianity, the term was changed to mean an evil spirit. The D&amp;D demons are primarily based on Judeo-Christian lore and mythology of the middle ages. Many pre-Christian gods were called demons as they were considered false-idols. Specific demons in D&amp;D are included below:

**Balor**

*First Appearance*:  First appeared (as a Balrog) in the fantasy supplement for Chainmail (1971), first appeared in D&amp;D (as a Balrog) in the original D&amp;D set (1974), and later in the Monster Manual (1977) as a Balor.

*Origin*: Name of an Irish giant (fomorian). Originally appeared as a Balrog, a powerful demon-like creature of shadow and fire from J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs *Fellowship of the Ring* (1954). Chainmail and the original D&amp;D set included many direct lifts from Tolkein (Hobbits, Ents, Orcs, Balrog, etc.) however many names were eventually changed due to legal reasons. The Balrog was renamed the Balor, which is the name of the leader of the Fomorians, a race of monstrous giants that were opponents of the first mythological settlers of Ireland (the Tuath D√© Danann). Balor was a powerful demonic giant, who killed the king of the Tuath D√©, but was slain in turn by his grandson Lugh. The appearance of the Balor is clearly based on the Balrog, even including the Balrog‚Äôs sword and many-tailed whip.

&gt;*‚ÄúIt came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*J.R.R. Tolkein, The Fellowship of the Ring, 1954*

&amp;#x200B;

**Bar-Lgura**

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

*Origin*: Listed in Lewis Spence‚Äôs *An Encyclopedia of Occultism* (1920) as ‚ÄúBar-Lgura : (Semitic demon ) : Sits on the roofs of houses and leaps on the inhabitants. People so afflicted are called d'baregara.‚Äù, though it is unclear what his source for this is.

&amp;#x200B;

**Demogorgon**

*Etymology*: Possibly from the Greek *daemon* (‚Äúspirit‚Äù) + *gorgos* (‚Äúterrible‚Äù). Alternately, a misread of the Greek *demiurge* (‚Äúcraftsman‚Äù, referring to the creator of the universe), and accusative form of which is *dƒìmiourg√≥n*. A name attributed to a pagan god or demon, dating to the 4th century.

*First Appearance*: First appeared in the original D&amp;D Eldritch Wizardry Supplement (1976) by Dave Arneson, later in the Monster Manual (1977)

*Origin*: Possible a grammatical error in a translation is the source of the name. The oldest mention of the name is in the commentary of Statius‚Äôs *Thebaid*, made in the 4th century by Lactantius Placidus. In one manuscript, the author says of Statius, *Dicit deum Demogorgona summum, cuius scire nomen non licet* (""He is speaking of the Demogorgon, the supreme god, whose name it is not permitted to know""). The word took on it‚Äôs own life, and by the middle ages, Demogorgon was considered an ancient god, and is referred to in texts as demon, and became incorporated into Christian mythology as a demon of hell.

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual (1977)

*Origin*: In roman mythology, manes are the souls of the dead, similar to Lates and Lemures. Considered deities of the underworld, Roman graves often included an inscription D.M. (*diis manibus*, ‚Äúfor the ghost-gods‚Äù), or ‚Äúfor the manes‚Äù. Manes were offered blood sacrifices, and possibly were honored at gladiatorial games.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manes)

&gt;*‚ÄúApuleius ""says, indeed, that the souls of men are demons, and that men become Lares if they are good, Lemures or Larvae if they are bad, and Manes if it is uncertain whether they deserve well or ill... He also states that the blessed are called in Greek Œµ·ΩêŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒºŒøŒΩŒµœÇ \[eudaimones\], because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that the souls of men are demons.‚Äù*

*First Appearance*: First appeared in the original D&amp;D Eldritch Wizardry Supplement (1976) by Dave Arneson, later in the Monster Manual (1977)

*Origin*: Orcus was a Roman god of the underworld and punisher of broken oaths. The name was also used as a general term for the underworld (similar to Hades). Being a god of the underworld, he was conflated with demons and hell in Christian lore, and *orco* became used as a name for any man-eating monster.. It is possible that the French word *ogre* comes from *orco.* The name was also used by J.R.R. Tolkein for the race of Orcs.

Should any man be put to death in Israel today?*‚Äù (2 Sa 19:22). In Hebrew, the word adversary is satan, which may be how Abishai‚Äôs name became associated with the devil, though in context it is clear this is not the literal meaning of the passage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Amon**

*Etymology*: Egyptian

*First Appearance*: Monster Manual II (1983)

Origin: Amun (Amon) was an Egyptian deity and patron of Thebes. As Amun-Ra, he was a creator deity and became viewed as the chief deity above the other Egyptian gods. Later, Amon was listed as a demon in the *Ars Goetia* (a section of the *Lesser Key of Solomon*, a 17th century grimoire). Amon was a Marquis of hell, who appeared as a wolf with a serpent‚Äôs tail or a man with a dog‚Äôs teeth in the head of a raven.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammon)

&amp;#x200B;

DnD,Aidamis,9,"List of spell that stay on while a Barbarian is raging - feedback appreciated  

Quick list, ultimately looking into building a complete list. Feel free to use it as your cheat sheet :

Preambula:  
\*If it's on one of your classes' spell list (including expanded spell lists), you can cast it. But if it's of a higher level that what you can actually cast righ now, prepare for an Ability check using your spellcasting ability, DC10+Spell Level. So yes, a Cleric 1/Barbarian X can cast Commune, rage and keep asking questions or finish raging and resume asking provided there's time left.  
\*Hound of Ill Omen (Shadow Sorcerer 6+) cares not whether you're raging or not.  
\*I never mention that certain spell's duration may be doubled with the proper metamagic, but it could.  
\*Hexblade's Curse (Hexblade 1+) cares not whether you're raging or not.  
\*Protector Aasimar's wings are concentration-free, so is Divine Soul 14, Storm Sorcerer 17, Tempest Cleric 17 flight.  
\*Shapeshifting doesn't require concentration and at high enough level you may burn spell slots to heal while transformed.  
\*Divine and Eldritch Smite care not about you raging, but your rage bonus damage isn't doubled when you crit, unlike Orcish fury's extra die and Divine Favor's extra die (warning - not on this list, requires concentration. An ally can always cast it on you, though).  
\*Blessing of the Forge (Forge Cleric 1+) and Artificer's Infusions don't require concentration.  
\*Anytime you see ""Cleric"", Divine Soul Sorcerer can take it.  
\*Eldritch Knights can exceptionally select spells outside of Abjuration or Evocation, same for Arcane Tricksters and Enchantment and Illusion, as long as they're taking spells at levels 3, 8, 14, or 20 (but at this stage you're a ""Barbarian"" not a Barbarian). Thus anytime a Wizard spell outside of the aforementioned schools of level 1-3 is mentionned, theoretically you could grab it. I haven't mentionned the schools every time, sorry. Just assume that any time an EK can take it, it's usually Abj or Evoc, and any time an AT can take it, it's usually Ench or Illusion.  
\*Any spells where Tomelock is mentioned are rituals. Tomelock can potentially snatch any cantrip at level 3. Likewise cantrips are eligible for Magical Secrets.  
Shillelagh cantrip (Druid, Nature Cleric, Wood Elf Magic or Magic Initiate feats)  
Minor Illusion cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, Arcane Trickster Rogue, MI, Forest Gnome racial spell)  
Mold Earth cantrip (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Arcane Trickster Rogue, MI)  
Prestidigitation cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, MI)  
Light cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard, MI, Celestial Warlock and Light Cleric class spell, aasimar racial spell)  
Thaumaturgy (Cleric, MI, Tiefling racial spell)  
Message (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard, Arcane Trickster Rogue). You can cast it before you rage, and if the target seems hesitant you could theoretically do something like Action Surge and wait, technically it's still one round.  
\[Matt Mercer material: Wristpocket Conjuration Cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: S Duration: Instantaneous &lt;- any class with spellcasting or pact magic can learn it  
You flick your wrist with a flourish, causing a single object that weighs no more than 5 lbs that you hold within your hand to vanish. The object is actually transported and stored within a small extradimensional pocket plane. The object remains there indefinitely until this cantrip is cast again, upon which it is immediately transported back into your grasp. You cannot store an object while one already occupies the extradimensional pocket \]  
1st level - Alarm (Ranger, Wizard, Eldritch Knight Fighter, MI and RitCaster feats, Tomelock 3+ with the Book of Ancient Secrets Eldritch Invocation)  
1st level - Armor of Agathys (Warlock, Oath of Conquest Paladin, MI, Levistus Tiefling at 2nd level)

1st level - Ceremony (Cleric, Paladin, MS, MI, Ritual Caster, Tomelock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets )  
1st level - Comprehend Languages (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, Tomelock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets). Eyes of the Runekeeper Eldritch Invocation does the same with writing. Pact of the Great Old One warlocks can telepathically communicate with anyone within 30 ft and be understood.  
1st level - False Life (Sorcerer, Wizard, MS, MI). Same for Fiendish Vigor Eldritch Invocation (Warlock 2+)  
1st level - Feather Fall (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard, MI) &lt;- if you cast it as a reaction then rage afterwards, the spell remains ""on"".  
1st level - Gift of Alacrity (Wizard, MI, MS)  
1st level - Guiding Bolt (Cleric, MI, MS) - if you cast it and it lands then you rage as a bonus action, the secondary effect sticks around  
1st level - Longstrider (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard, MI, Wood Elf Magic Feat)  
1ts level - Mage Armor (Sorcerer, Wizard, MS, MI) You usually won't need it but who said you must be the target? Eldritch Invocation Armor of Shadows (Warlock 2+) sticks too.  
1st level - Sanctuary (Cleric, Oath of Devotion Paladin, MS, MI)  
1st level - Find Familiar (Wizard, MS, MI, Ritual Caster, Chain Warlock, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
1st level - Unseen Servant (Bard, Warlock, Wizard, MS, MI, Ritual Caster, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
1st level - Floating Disk (Wizard, MS, MI, Ritual Caster, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)

1st level - Purify Food and Drink (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
1st level - Identify (Bard, Wizard, Forge Cleric) - effect is instantaneous, memories stick.  
1st level - Goodberry (Druid, Ranger, MS, MI) the berries stick around for 24 hours. Life Cleric 1+ with this can provide ten berries which each granting 4 hp. It takes one action to take one or put one in someone's mouth (reanimation or healing).  
1st level - Speak with Animals (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Totem Warrior Barbarian (as a ritual, only spell a monoclass BB can learn other than Beast sense, racial spells and Dragonmark spells), MI, Ritual Caster, Tomelock 3+ with the Book of Ancient Secrets, Warlock 2+ with the Beast Speech Eldritch Invocation).  
Forest Gnome (limited ability), Firbolg (limited ability), Triton (limited ability).  
2nd level - Spiritual Weapon (Cleric and Oath of Conquest Paladin or Magical Secrets)  
2nd level - Warding Bond (Cleric and Oath of the Crown or MS, keep in mind that no damage resistance will stop the damage you take when the target of WB takes damage)  
2nd level - Aid (Cleric, Paladin, MS). Also stacks with temp HP.  
2nd level - Blindness/Deafness (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)  
2nd level - Mirror Image (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, Arcane Trickster Rogue, MS)  
2nd level - Find Steed (Paladin, MS)  
2nd level - Darkvision (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, MS)  
2nd level - Fortune's Favor (Wizard, MS)  
2nd level - Protection from Poison (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, MS). Totem warrior Bear might give you resistance but it won't give you Advantage on saves vs poison. Also - you could target other creatures.  
2nd level - Animal messenger (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Tomelock 3+ with the Book of Ancient Secrets)  
2nd level - Gentle Repose (Cleric, Wizard, MS, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
2nd level - Skywrite (Bard, Druid, Wizard, Artificer, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
2nd level - Magic Mouth (Bard, Wizard, Arcane Trickster, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
2nd level - Locate Animals of Plants (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets). Effect is instantaneous, but memories stick. Here's a big brain moment: if you're facing a seemingly bottomless pit - drop a cat in it, calculate how long it would take the cat to reach the bottom if it was about 5 miles deep then cast the spell either around that moment or in intervals. You can then gauge the depth. The cat should be fine, especially if you've cast Death Ward beforehand. A Chainlock with Voice of the Chain Master can send an imp downstream, cast sleep and recover the cat.  
\[ Lost Laboratory of Kwalish module : 2nd level - Flock of Familiars (Wizard, Warlock, MS). Requires 1 minute to cast. Lasts one hour. Doesn't require concentration.\]

special mention: Ascendant Step Eldritch Invocation (Warlock 9+). Levitate does require concentration, but first you could theoretically rise up, rage as a bonus action, then Feather fall as a reaction and still float. This would require a very specific situation (you defending against harpies for instance, or you expecting to be hit by something the turn after you've raged)  
3rd level - Phantom Steed (Wizard, Arcane Trickster Rogue, MS, Tomelock 5+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
3rd level - Leomund's Tiny Hut (Bard, Wizard, Eldritch Knight Fighter, Tomelock 5+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)

3rd level - Glyph of Warding (Bard, Cleric, Wizard, Eldritch Knight Fighter)  
3rd level - Plant Growth (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Nausicaa) No matter how you use it, the effects stick around  
3rd level - Motivational Speech (Bard, Cleric). The temp HP and advantage on Wisdom saves stick. Effect of Inspiring Leader likewise though they don't stack, just mentioning IL since it seemed relevant. Most Barbarians wouldn't take it, but you could be a PalaBB or a Bard with a BB dip.  
3rd level - Remove Curse (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard, Eldritch Knight Fighter). Meaning that if you cast it, break the bond between a cursed magic item and the owner, then rage, your achievement remains in play.  
3rd level - Speak with Dead (Bard, Cleric). Lasts 10 minutes. Non-concentration.  
3rd level - Water Breathing (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, Arcane Trickster Rogue, Tomelock 5+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
3rd level - Water Walk (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Tomelock 5+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
3rd level - Meld Into Stone (Cleric, Druid, Tome Warlock 5+ with Book of Ancient Secrets). Surprise, Chief Kief Trucker!  
4rth level - Find Greater Steed (Paladin, MS)  
4rth level - Death Ward (Cleric, Paladin, MS)  
4rth level - Guardian of Faith (Cleric, MS)  
4rth level - Freedom of Movement (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, MS)  
4rth level - Hallucinatory Terrain (Bard, Cleric, Warlock, Wizard, high level Arcane Trickster Rogue)  
4rth level - Feign death (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard, high level Arcane Trickster Rogue, Tomelock 7+with the Book of Ancient Secrets) &lt;- doesn't need to be on you. This does mean that if you used it on someone, feel free to rage.  
4rth level - Fire Shield (Wizard, MS, high level Arcane Trickster Rogue)  
5th level - Conjure Elemental (Druid, Wizard, MS) - only for the part when if you rage you lose control of it, but in the right circumstances that's fine  
5th level - Planar Binding (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard, MS, Tomelock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets) - also allows you to keep the aforementioned Elemental your pet for a certain duration. Concentration requirement becomes waived on the creature in question.  
5th level - Hallow (Cleric, MS) Until dispelled.  
5th level - Rary's Telepathic Bond (Wizard, MS, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
5th level - Telepathic Bond (Wizard, MS, Tome Warlock 3+ with Book of Ancient Secrets) Could be the same as above.  
5th level - Commune (Cleric, MS, Tomelock 9+ with the Book of Ancient Secrets). Lasts one minute. Technically, after you've cast it, if some moron pisses you off, feel free to rage.  
5th level - Commune with Nature (Druid, Ranger, Tomelock 9+ with the Book of Ancient Secrets, Team Rocket sometimes). Effect's instantaneous, but the memories stick.  
5th level - Contact Other Plane (Warlock, Wizard, Tomelock 9+ with the Book of Ancient Secrets who can spare the spells known slot and would rather seek a scroll or a spellbook). It's on for one minute. Feel free to rage. Just be aware that there's a DC15 Intelligence saving throw, so feel free to plug in your Gnome Artificer 1/Barbarian 3/Paladin 2/Warlock 14 backed up by a Halfling with Bountiful Luck who can cast Resistance on you.

6th level - Heroes' Feast (Cleric, Druid, MS)  
6th level - Conjure Fey (Warlock, Wizard, MS) - only in the sense that the creatures stick around when concentration is broken. Could still be in your interests in certain situations.  
6th level - Contingency (Wizard, MS)  
6th level - Drawmij's Instant Summons (Wizard, MS, Tome Warlock 11+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)  
6th level - Instant Summons (Wizard, MS, Tome Warlock 11+ with Book of Ancient Secrets). Could be the same spell as above.  
6th level - Forbiddance (Cleric, MS, Tome Warlock 11+ with Book of Ancient Secrets)

7th level - Forcecage (Bard, Warlock, Wizard, level 17 Arcana Cleric)  
7th level - Etherealness (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)  
7th level - Simulacrum (Wizard, MS, level 17 Arcana Cleric) Until dispelled.  
7th level - Temple of the Gods (Cleric, MS) Hi Zealot 7/Cleric 13 who erected a Temple of Doom. Hi Dionysus Troll Bard.

8th level - Mind Blank (Bard, Wizard, level 17 Arcana Cleric)

9th level - Foresight (Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard, level 17 Arcana Cleric)  
Only after you've successfully maintained concentration for one hour - True Polymorph (Bard, Warlock, Wizard, level 17 Arcana Cleric)  
9th level - Wish (Sorcerer, Wizard, MS at level 18, level 17 Arcana Cleric)

Other: Pass Without Trace is a 2nd level (base) Druid of Ranger spell (Bards can take it via Magical Secrets). It's Concentration but it's very useful. You may ambush quite effectively with it. When you spring your trap, feel free to rage.

Keep in mind that potions don't count as concentration spells. If you can cast Enlarge/Reduce and are proficient in Alchemist' Tools, you may craft a Potion of Growth if you're of high enough level and have access to a workshop and materials. Similarly if you can cast Polymorph, you may make potions of Polymorph.

I might do an excel file, but maybe later.

Feel free to leave feedback and mention anything I ommited (Artificers of could be eligible for certain spells yet I forgot to include them).  
Thank you.

- the ability to help my team by having some healing ability

So far, the options I have come up with are:

Option 1:
- take Healer feat, then
- take Magic initiate feat; depending on the class, I could get: Sacred Flame, Acid Splash, Poison Spray, Firebolt (but no proficiency bonus), or Eldritch Blast (but no proficiency bonus)


Option 2:
- multiclass into Cleric at Level 6 or higher

DnD,owengaming001,67,"My DM hates my charisma stat and won't let me roll persuasion. I have a level 8 wizard who has a +13 in persuasion (don't ask, it's a long story). Anyway, basically all of my other stats (except intellegence) are complete garbage.

This was fine, because usually my character's role was mostly just to cast spells and persuade NPCs, until my DM got tired of me persuading everyone.

My DM is now telling me I have to talk it out instead of rolling. I would be fine with this to an extent, or even fully if it wasn't my main stat. But he's basically not letting me roll persuasion at all. This is kinda a huge nerf to my character.

Usually what would happen is: I would say I wanted to persuade an NPC, then I would present reasons why they should do whatever I wanted them to do, the. I would role.

But now the process is: I say I want to persuade the NPC, I present reasons for them to do whatever I want them to do, he tells me to talk it out instead of rolling, and then I proceed to fail to persuade them because I am not as good at persuasion as my character.

Is this something I should just except?

If not, how can I convince him that this isn't what he should be doing?

And if charisma is handled this way, why aren't any of the other stats handled similarly?",1

DnD,felinenurse,45,"My DM appropriated my agency as a player, and I don‚Äôt know if I want to play anymore. We were in the final fight of a short arc, facing the DM‚Äôs BBEG. My character, as a lawful evil character, didn‚Äôt have a lot of motivation to participate in the fight. The morals of saving the city didn‚Äôt really appeal to her. The other members of the party were more engaged in the arc, and mine was more of the big gun coming in to aid them. (Which, I personally love playing a combat oriented fighter).


As the battle started, the bbeg used the spell command on me, instructing me to, ‚Äú*Kill* the murderer.‚Äù (Referring to one of the party members who had murdered the bbeg‚Äôs son earlier in the arc.) This particular party member was not well liked by my character, as she saw him as weak and feeble. As such, she followed the ‚Äòcommand‚Äô to kill, and directed it towards that party member, striking out at him for her turn.


My character has a very strong aversion to being manipulated and to mind control in general. At the end of her turn, I roleplayed her anger and her newfound motivation to kill the bbeg. She was now invested in the fight.¬†


This game was all being played with text. At this time, I did not mention that the command spell can only be a one word command and he couldn‚Äôt have actually specified a target ((EDIT:  In my excitement at starting this battle at last, I did not initially connect the dots with the command spell and it's limits. )) Awesome rp opportunity in my book: I felt that was a great way to get her invested in this boss battle - a personal vendetta against the boss himself.


The fight continued, and my character was very interested in killing this commander as revenge for his manipulation of her. The fight continues, and he uses the command spell again like this, against other party members. I again said nothing. ((It wasn't very engaging, and specifics slipped my mind while I wasn't reacting or playing ic))


At the very conclusion of the battle, the commander was at critically low health, engaged in melee with my character and one of only three other characters with whom my PC is actually friends with. The bbeg again used command - casting at a second level to target both of us - instructing us to ‚Äò*kill* eachother‚Äô.¬†


We both failed the save, and the command word itself was again, *kill*. This was actually really exciting for me, as I saw a golden opportunity. I roleplayed my character mocking the commander, saying that she would indeed ‚Äòkill‚Äô, and I proceeded to have her slay the bbeg. (She is a 13th level fighter and he was at critical health; he fell on her first attack.)


Again I mention that this was the final battle in the arc. The commander was at critically low health. I had personally discussed this fight with the DM running the game, and knew that he did not intend this bbeg to survive the battle. (We had even discussed what items each of the party members could loot from his body; it was my understanding that the bbeg would not make it out alive.)


My interpretation and actions on my turn were met with distinct disagreement. Following my turn, the DM pm‚Äôd me, saying that I didn‚Äôt follow the command appropriately. The DM told me I needed to attack my ally. I countered, telling him that the command spell didn‚Äôt work that way, that he should have used suggestion (or dominate person, really) for what he was trying to accomplish. I clarified that he wanted the command word to be ‚Äòkill‚Äô, and he said yes. After a bit of back and forth, he told me that since I hadn‚Äôt spoken up through the rest of the fight, he would now need to retcon that entire thing.¬†


Throughout this private conversation, I grew pretty upset. I felt railroaded, that my agency had been taken, that this was too much power he wanted to impose for a first level spell. Part of my upset was due to the pride I felt in the poetic irony of the bbeg thinking he had more power than he did, underestimating my intelligence and resolve, and overestimating his own magic‚Äôs ability. I expressed some exacerbation with the entire conflict (ooc not ic) and stepped away from the conversation.


Soon after, one of the other players pm‚Äôd me. He stated that I was putting the DM in a bad spot by not attacking my ally. He went on about how the DM has the final say, that I was ignoring the rulings, and I was ‚Äúliving in a power fantasy‚Äù. Our conversation had the effect of infuriating me, invoking a sense of betrayal, making me feel walked over, etc, and I found myself in tears.


As this conversation continued, I received another pm from another of the players. (Neither player was my character‚Äôs ally nor the one my pc had attacked earlier in the fight.) He also said that I needed to follow the DM‚Äôs ruling and attack my ally.¬†


I‚Äôm now feeling defeated and overall very upset. I go back to the game, retcon my attack, and attack my ally instead. I just want to be done, and I‚Äôm worked up so much that my interest in continuing the game has been utterly lost. This ordeal took 2-3 hours.


Following my retcon of my turn, the DM decided *not* to retcon the whole fight and to allow my attack to go through. At this point, I literally can‚Äôt stand to be in the game anymore, and I let everyone know I needed to take a break, and that they could bot my character.


That was two days ago now, and I‚Äôm still upset over the whole thing, which brings me near tears just thinking about.¬†


Edit:
I'd like to add that this fight took place over 3 days of text rp. The first time I had the command was on day 1, and the DM had been talking to me about wanting to kill off the 'murderer' PC ooc. It was a problematic player and character. 

And by the time I was thinking about command, two irl days had gone by. This post about the commander casting on me was what I woke up to on the third morning. And I read it, and was thinking, this can't be right, and I looked into the command spell.",1

# Devil's Eyes

*Wondrous item, artefact* *(requires attunement)*

These are two obsidian spheres that pulse faintly with reddish light. If they are separated from each other by more than 7 miles, they teleport to the nearest available space at the midpoint between their locations.

When someone attunes to this item, the eyes instantly take the place of the owner's biological eyes. If the attunement ends, the Devil's Eyes fall out of the sockets, leaving the biological eyes behind and intact. Whilst in the eye sockets, the Eyes are filled with faint infernal flames.

Anyone attuned to the Devil's Eyes can see as if they were using functioning biological eyes and can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

*The following effects are curses.*

Mephistopheles, the archdevil who created the Devil's Eyes, can see through them. If the item is attuned, Mephistopheles can force the owner to make a DC17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the owner comes under Mephistopheles' complete control for 12 seconds. On a success, the owner is blinded for 6 seconds as the eyes temporarily cease to function. This effect can occur two times. The Eyes regain all uses at midnight.",1

My group has been playing together for around 5 years now on and off. It‚Äôs me, my gf, and my 3 cousins. Cousin 1 and I usually trade off being DM every 6-months or so. We all have busy work schedules so sometimes we don‚Äôt play for 1-2 months at a time, but usually we can play once/2 weeks.

The problem I‚Äôve been noticing for the past year since we started a new campaign is that none of my players are sticking with their characters. And listen, I completely understand the fun of making new characters all the time. But it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to weave their characters into the main over-arching narrative when they‚Äôre essentially becoming new people every few months.

Last year I made a whole new homebrew campaign with all new characters and this has how it‚Äôs went:

Gf: Playing the same PC but keeps saying she‚Äôs scared of her character dying so she‚Äôs gonna retire the PC soon

Cousin 1: Played one character, made a new one, the new one died, so he‚Äôs playing the first character again

Cousin 2: Played a character that‚Äôs friend died (see above dead PC) in combat shortly after starting, so she made a new character, and now she‚Äôs getting bored of her NEW PC she‚Äôs played for 5 sessions and talking about making a new one

Cousin 3: Playing the same PC from the start, but is getting bored with him and wants to wrap up his story rq so he can make a new character

I just don‚Äôt know how to win with these guys. I‚Äôm trying to weave their stories into the bigger picture but they‚Äôre not giving me enough time to do it naturally. And when I have done it, they‚Äôre making a new character so all that story I‚Äôve built around them means nothing.

As we continue on I‚Äôm finding it harder and harder to do it. Should I just stop giving them story beats and railroad them into more generic quests? I‚Äôm at a loss.

TLDR: My players keep ditching their characters for new ones and it‚Äôs getting harder to write character based stories for them. Should I just let it happen or lay down the law and say no new characters?",1

DnD,TrickAndShorty,1,"The most unpredictable D&amp;D session you could play. I may have just quickly workshopped this idea around that mis-matched ability check meme that‚Äôs floating around r/dndmemes right now. Essentially, this would be an incredibly unpredictable, hyper-chaotic way to run a one shot (or longer!) when you have absolutely no ideas for a story. Literally all you would need is the location the players start in; the rest is improv. Let me explain the mechanics:

Whenever a skill check needs to be made, roll a d20 to determine what skill check will be used. This will influence the scenario. For example: your bard tried to seduce the lovely barmaid. Instead of rolling for persuasion, the player rolls a d20 and lands on a 5, resulting in an athletics check. This is actually the toughest barmaid in the town, and the only way you‚Äôre getting into her loins is via an arm wrestling match. Now the bard makes his athletics roll to see if he has what it takes to not be dominated. The rogue wants to pick a lock to the town master‚Äôs secret room? Roll for your check. 16, Religion check. The rogue isn‚Äôt proficient in religion, so her check fails. The rogue fails to notice the lock on the door has a symbol of Tiamat on it, leading them miss an opportunity to realize the town master‚Äôs dark secrets. Maybe that pit brawler the barbarian was fighting actually had poison laced on his nails after the dice determined a medicine check was needed. Maybe you‚Äôre trying to lie to the barkeep to get information, but your roll calls for insight and you notice the doppelg√§nger barkeep slip up a bit, seeming a bit off, before you even have a chance to lie.

There is no predetermined story, and no known outcome of any check until YOU the DM decide how to interpret the rolls! This will obviously take a DM who is very keen on improv and flying by the seat of their pants (though, aren‚Äôt we all?). I‚Äôm certainly going to assemble a group to experiment with the chaos, and I hope you all do as well! The possibilities created from this are bound only by your imagination. I have included below what I assigned the dice rolls to for determining the skill check required. Feel free to give any feedback; this was definitely a quick idea I had while browsing reddit working from home haha.

Skill check associated with d20 roll:

1: Roll again, make rolled check with disadvantage

2: Acrobatics

3: Animal Handling

4: Arcana

5: Athletics

6: Deception

7: History

8: Insight

9: Intimidation

10: Investigation

11: Medicine

12: Nature

13: Perception

14: Performance

15: Persuasion

DnD,Orderofomega,4,"Break the PC Monotony in D&amp;D 5e with 3 Easy Tips As much as I love *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* *Fifth Edition*, I admit I sometimes stare longingly at my 3.5e materials and reminisce on the zany character concepts I built using the plethora of skill choices and feats available in that system. Then I recall how absolutely insane it was to keep track of the 20 different feats I acquired (looking at you, Fighter) along the way and how some of them were absolutely useless or intentional stepping-stones to the concept I wanted to actually make.

Fifth Edition does a *remarkable* job of balancing the customization options available in Third Edition while keeping some of the simplicity provided by Fourth Edition. That simplicity, unfortunately, comes at a cost; by the time you've experienced a class (played, watched via stream, or both) more than twice, you have a pretty good idea how that character is going to play out in any adventure moving forward. From this experience comes the unfortunately all-too-common complaint, ""Every \[Insert Class Name\] feels the same in 5e."" While I respect this opinion, it's wrong. Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, mistaken. But, it's easy to see from where the mistake stems. You see, Fifth Edition has three *incredibly simple* tricks you can use to infuse your PCs with fresh mechanics and play styles every time, but they're hiding in plain sight and thus never get discussed. If you're someone who loves playing a particular class over and over again (like me with the Sorcerer), but is worried about eventual class burnout, I implore you to heed these tips, try them, and see you had nothing to fear.

With that in mind...

# 1) Create Custom Backgrounds

When someone says Backgrounds, our first thoughts trail to the Acolyte, Criminal, Folk Hero, and others listed in Chapter 4 of the *Players Handbook*. Or, perhaps you're a bit more adventurous and use additional options provided in materials like *Curse of Strahd* or *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*. The one thing most of us, myself included, often forget is these Background options **are just examples**. We rush so quickly to the list of Background options that we miss the fact the rules for creating your own Background are listed before we even get to the Acolyte. This document layout choice, according to Jeremy Crawford, is quite intentional.

If that's the case, if the game is built with the intent of creating our own Backgrounds, then why do so few players and DM's make them? I believe there are two primary reasons for this:

* It's easier to say, ""Want to play a Rogue? Pick the Criminal Background,"" for Players during character creation than it is to build a Background from the ground-up.
* To the development team's credit, most of the example Backgrounds capture the essence of many fantasy character archetypes and suit the needs of many characters.

One major downsides to these example Backgrounds, however, is their lack of personal connection to your characters. When you slap these onto a PC, often towards the end of your character creation process, the Background gets treated solely as a means to squeeze in two extra skill proficiencies and an odd language or tool you'll use once or twice for the novelty. When you build a Background to suit your character's needs, however, you come out the other end with a set of skills and other features that reinforce your desired play style regardless of class mechanics.

To demonstrates how easy and effective this is, let's build a custom Background right here! As a way to foreshadow my Rogue's eventual progression into Arcane Trickster prior to 3rd Level, I'm going to create a Library Rat background that selects the **Arcana** and **Sleight of Hand** proficiencies. Next, I decide as someone who skulked around in places of learning all his life, this Background grants me access to two additional Languages of my choice. Being an Aladdin-esque vagabond, I choose an equipment list similar to the one provided by the Urchin example background, but replace the town map and family token with a book on the fundamentals of magic. I then pick the **Researcher** feature to stay true to the library motif and wrap things up by selecting my own characteristics or using samples from the Sage/Urchin as needed. Just like that, a new Background is born!

See how easy that was, and how more likely your character is to use the benefits granted by a Background when they sync perfectly to your concept? Simple tricks like this can help define your character far beyond race and class mechanics.

Before we move on, a word of caution regarding Backgrounds: be extra mindful of which primary feature you select. Some features, like the Folk Hero's **Rustic Hospitality** or the Sage's **Researcher**, are amazing choices for their flexibility and utility in most adventures.

Other features, like the Hermit's **Discovery** and Sailor's **Ship Passage**, are so situational you'll rarely have a chance to bust them out. While **Ship Passage** is the more viable of the two, ensure the campaign has a fair amount of boat travel before selecting this option. **Discovery** is just...I'll be honest, I hate this feature. As a Player, expect your discovery to be either the kick-off to an adventure or the missing clue that pulls together some major revelation in the story. Regardless, you're only going to use it once, if ever. As a DM, you have to ensure the discovery is ""unique and powerful"" enough to justify serving as a primary component of the PC's Background, and even then its relevance will be short lived for the use cases stated above. Worst-case scenario, you're going to feed the PC some esoteric piece of world lore that, while interesting to you, will have little-to-no bearing on the overall story and leave the PC sitting on it for the entire campaign. I'm sure there are success stories of **Discovery** being used for great effect, but compared to other features with practical applications, the ""grand revelation"" bestowed by this feature is best left to a plot-critical NPC.

# 2) Remove Class-Based Skill Restrictions at 1st Level

During character creation, each class notes how many starting skill proficiencies you get and tells you to pick from a selection of about six or seven options. The Wizard, for example, tells you to choose two skills from **Arcana**, **History**, **Insight**, **Investigation**, **Medicine**, and **Religion**. The skills you select then add your proficiency score to any check made with that skill. The scope of these options are broad, and the additional choices provided by custom Backgrounds should be enough to sate most concept choices.

To liberate any Players who feel pigeonholed by these restrictions, simply allow them to pick the number of proficiencies provided by their class from *all* the skills in the game. If they want a Wizard who specializes in **Athletics** and **Stealth**, let them if they can provide an adequate reason! Before setting them loose, always mention the skill options listed in the class are there by design: they're often the most beneficial options for the scenarios PCs of that class will likely find themselves in (i.e. the Wizard often being asked to deduce the nature of magical effects via **Arcana**). If they still wish to pick other options, let them do so!

I find this solution is most viable in cases where the PCs are all the same class (e.g. a Hogwarts-style Wizard School campaign), and everyone wants to focus on different interactive skills. Or, maybe a Player enjoys playing a specific Class but isn't interested in the provided Skills this time around. As long as it makes sense for the character and doesn't impede the party dynamics (though I don't see how this would be an issue), Players will greatly appreciate this additional level of customization.

# 3) Incorporate Blessings and Charms

For our last tip, we're going to explore content that allows you to stretch your homebrewing muscles while using some Rules as Written material if you'd rather play it straight and narrow. Better yet, the suggestions offered below will guarantee your PCs are not ""just another School of Illusion Wizard."" We're pulling out the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for this one as we discuss Blessings and Charms.

First up is Blessings, qualified as a game-enhancing ""supernatural gift \[...\] usually bestowed by a god or godlike being"" (DMG p. 227). The book recommends offering these to PCs either as a reward for accomplishing a heroic task, like restoring a favored shrine of the benefactor deity, or as a kind of ""cash advance"" for a task they're about to accomplish. These bonuses are permanent unless the blessed PC does something to anger their benefactor, like failing to complete the chosen quest. The DMG provides seven different examples for Blessings; some provide Ability Score increases, one converts weapons into their *+1* variants, and others still that enhance your defensive capabilities by boosting AC or granting the Magic Resistance effect. Just like Backgrounds, these examples are meant to serve as a starting point for you to create your own divine wonders.

When you connect these gifts to a godly being whose presence is felt constantly throughout the campaign, like the Morninglord from *Curse of Strahd*, it connects the PCs to the story beyond their Backgrounds or original call to adventure. While you can present these Blessings to PCs on an individual basis, I've always introduced mine as a group choice; the benefactor provides a list of options, but the PCs can only pick one to apply to the everyone. It's an important choice they weigh together with no downside. It allows the min-maxing and thematic choices to be discussed in an organic way that has a lasting effect on the entire party. It's amazing to behold, but something you should only grant once (or maybe twice if you're generous) during the course of a long-running adventure.

Also, make sure you've carefully weighed how the Blessing(s) will impact your game moving forward. Unlike magic items, which we often believe can be handed out recklessly because they sound fun and then stripped away if they're deemed overpowered, Blessings have an inherent gravity to them. They are explicitly granted to your PCs by someone critical to your setting, and the loss of such an important gift will certainly feel personal to PCs and the Players who control them.

Charms, the fickle cousins to Blessings, are geared towards granting the effects of magical items, potions, or spells until the bearer has expending a predetermined number of uses. When exhausted, the Charm vanishes and the PC must obtain a new Charm of the same type to regain the abilities granted. Unlike Blessings, Charms come from more mundane sources and, as such, are expected to be used with greater abandon. Perhaps capturing a unicorn yields an unexpected reward as the mythical being offers unique Charms in exchange for its freedom, or standing in the realm of a long-forgotten progenitor race infuses the adventurers with some latent magics. Granting Charms is an eloquent way for both you *and* the Player to test out certain effects, like allowing the Fighter to cast a 3rd-level version of *Conjure Animals*, before turning them into full-blown magic items or Blessings. Some Charms will come and go without second thought while others will spark an entire adventure as the PCs attempt to retain that ability permanently.

# Conclusion

Originally, I was going to include how to create custom Feats based on the actions performed in your campaign, similar to how *Neverwinter Nights* provided these specialized buffs at certain points in the game. The more I thought about it, however, the more I realized there is just **so** much to unpack with Feats (and this post is getting long enough) that it's a conversation best saved for a post all of its own.

With that, here are three easy ways you can use (or gently side-step) *D&amp;D 5e*'s rules to break out of the ""Every Fighter feels the same"" argument. Even if you entirely disagree with Tip 2, which I respect, the other two suggestions are mechanics *built into the game* yet garner such little attention. If you're a Player who feels this way about your PCs, I strongly encourage you to talk with your DM about customized Backgrounds or, if you're already in the middle of an adventure, exciting Charms or Blessings that might infuse some extra life into your character.

If you're a DM, don't sleep on these options; they're such easy ways to enhance your Players' experiences and create characters that will be remembered and retold time and time again. Also, with *Mystic Odysseys of Theros* coming out in July, what better way to connect your Players to the Gods and Goddesses of this setting (or your own setting which liberally applies concepts from Theros...like mine) than by having the PCs chase after the mythical Blessings of their patron deity?

DnD,Dehoniesto_,22,"Should I stop playing evil characters? While most of the time I play good or neutral aligned characters, sometimes I make one who is outright evil. They never do something just because ‚Äúit‚Äôs evil‚Äù but rather have their own reasoning and rarely do something drastic without thinking about it first. This however sometimes leads to situations with the rest of the party that are less than favorable. 

The instance I‚Äôm thinking about the most was where a new pc (the player asked the dm to let his last character die so he could play a new one) had baselessly accused my character of having murdered his friends several years back and threatened to kill him. (Yeah I don‚Äôt get why he did that either) My character mocked him for jumping to such conclusions and said that he would learn more in time. He then proceeded to insult my character, who wasn‚Äôt taking any more of his bs. I casted create bondfire under him, he failed the dex save and I rolled max damage, downing him. (He was already really hurt because he is a changeling and transformed into the player‚Äôs previous character, and tried to impersonate him so I threatened and casted chaos bolt on him when he refused to identify himself) 

While we did stabilize him the player was really upset about how he was being treated, and while I apologized, in the end that was the only thing my character would have done in that situation and he would do it again though I personally don‚Äôt want to hurt my teammates.",1

DnD,DeviantBumble,9,"Reading of modules Audiobook style Hey there everyone. I'm a voice actor and have done audiobooks, video games, and some ad work. I've recently thought about reading the DnD modules for people with dyslexia or issues with reading in general. My only issues are of course the legality issues of reading a module verbatim. I've thought of possibly having the buyer of the service provide proof of ownership of the material being requested before providing the accompanying voice audio. And then also having a statement of not allowing sharing of the file to anyone else, much like ROMs in video gaming are provided. Does anyone have any knowledge on the best way I could provide this service, i.e. Patreon, Fiverr, Dmsguild, so on and so forth. Thanks guys :)

And just a heads up to anyone saying the modules are not really meant to be read this way. (as you may need to go back to something to reference something quickly) I would be recording much of these things in short chapter like formats, with descriptive titles, as well as a full length file, allowing people to easily jump from section to section as needed. Basically an audiobook with actual functionality, not just a mundane read through.

So, I wrote it.  Hope you enjoy!

The ballad of the Em'prer of the Waves
Set to the tune of Pastures of Plenty
https://youtu.be/bZ09oXwqaig

'Twas an ominous day in the sitting l storm's salty spray.
There hove a dark shadow, Em'prer of the Waves!
Into the long boat and forward we go,
To find the chest that was stowed, down below.

'Twas Sarthak, Balmur, Varanthian, and Bree
Dalagrim and Elias, together were we.
We scaled the near rail, with our weapons drawn,
Determined that we were to see, the next dawn.

Ettercaps and spiders arose from the gloom.
Fangs and poison, they threatened our doom!
We fought back, ferocious, the webs' dark veil,
We struck them down, vicious, with weapon and spell.

They fell down before us, their bodies now cold.
We headed below decks, into the dark hold.

A shaman, he met us, eyes gleaming and mad.
He gathered against us the power he had!
Summoned spiders, maw demons, and the hateful ghasts!
The battle raged hard, we threw all we had.
We pulled up the chest, warring to and fro!
How little we knew how the battle would go!

We fought on the deck, saw tentacles rise!
Giant octopus returned, to claim its great prize!
All across the deck, we slid as we fought!
The ship tilted and shuddered, the lines they grew taut.

We fought demons and ghasts in the rain's sheeting gown.
The beast pulled and thrashed to pull Em'prer down.

The long boat came for us, crewed by all brave men! 
We leapt from the Em'prer, clear of the din.
Back to the Sea Ghost, all hands we did row!
As we watched the great beast pull Em'prer down below.

'Twas an ominous day in the sitting l storm's salty spray.
There went a dark shadow, Em'prer of the Waves!
On back to Saltmarsh did we all go,
Now the Em'prer rests, down below.!&lt;",1
DnD,elizacelli,7,"1 DM to another... help I don‚Äôt know if this is the subreddit for this... 

I‚Äôm a DM, and I‚Äôm in a campaign where the DM is younger and this is her first time DMing.  We were all very excited to support her but now we‚Äôre some sessions in and she railroads a LOT.  She obviously has 1 plan for how things will unfold and ANYTHING outside of that is not allowed, but she also doesn‚Äôt make it clear to us what she expects us to do.  This results in 10-20 minutes of confusion from us as we try to figure out what to do before she finally tells us what we ‚Äúshould‚Äù be doing. Last session all the players were in agreement wanting to do something a certain way and she told us she wouldn‚Äôt allow it at all because its not what she planned.  We don‚Äôt feel like we have actual choices. She changes a lot of plot points between sessions, or forgets them.  She doesn‚Äôt give us RP time or do anything with our characters... everyone in the campaign is sort of just done with it but since it‚Äôs her first time and she‚Äôs so excited we don‚Äôt want to quit.  

I‚Äôve considered reaching out as a fellow DM with tips or even just concerns, but I also don‚Äôt want to overstep my bounds or make her feel bad. I‚Äôm also fairly new to DMing so I don‚Äôt want to stick my foot in my mouth and look like a jerk. The other players are also in my campaign and the difference in player attitudes is astronomical.  In her campaign we are tired after 2 hours because we are confused about the ever-changing story and can‚Äôt do what we‚Äôd like. We feel like our time and our characters are being wasted.  But I don‚Äôt know if I should approach her about it, or how..

TLDR: my DM is new and we players are not enjoying her railroading and as a DM I‚Äôd like to give her tips but I don‚Äôt want to overstep my bounds.",1

DnD,HereticIronWarrior,4,"(half) Rant, (half) Help plz: one of our DnD campaigns (with the nerdiest DM) has stopped being an interaction between friends, and more like an official job/working in a company. So, where do I begin? about ten minutes ago I left the discord channel for our game because this annoyed me a lot. most of the people in our group are nerds, but this guy is of the highest order. let's call him Eddie. a multitude of things have come about in the campaign he is currently running (let me add - I love the campaign, the world, the story, etc, I'm not complaining about that. but, )

The first one is that despite us just being a group of friends, who usually like to mess about and joke about and not really take much seriously, the game has evolved into an area where no messing about is tolerated, and no jokes, or fun random things like sarcastic responses to NPCs, or threatening NPCs who are dicks. to further enhance this, our DM has put ""official warnings"" on me for f\*cking about (swearing's fine on Reddit, right?)

Secondly (maybe lastly, IDK how many points I've got lol) is that the other nerdiest dude in our group, let's call him, er, kyle seems to be against fun too. I think that Eddie usually takes the side of kyle, and this is why the weird rules have come up. an example of kyle is when I was threatening to cast fireball to an angry mob of villagers, to intimidate them into coming to overthrow their leader (a necromancer), kyle was up a mountain. let me point out that kyle's character would not have known what I was doing. when I started casting fireball (i wasn't going to cast it) kyle's character thought it so offensive, that he polymorphed into a crow, flew out, and killed himself. for something, he couldn't see. kyle later admitted that he just wanted a reason to leave the call, because apparently I was being such a d\*ck that he needed to do that.

TL;DR: I left today's discord game because it was becoming annoying that the game is becoming less a meeting between friends, and more a meeting. Eddie takes the side of kyle, who thinks that fun stinks.

upon review: yes, I know I sound hypocritical for complaining about someone leaving, and then leaving, but it's for different reasons

edit: I forgot, what can I do to stop these issues?",1

DnD,lynnvermi,5,"Let's Start in a Tavern‚Äì nay, an Ice Cream Shop! My campaign is set in a magical 21-st century type of city, and the players are a group of teens joining an Adventuring Academy. My players are relatively new to Dungeons &amp; Dragons (it's their second campaign), so I wanted them to feel comfortable running their characters and get used to the basic mechanics before I present them the main story hook. 

Inspired by the classic ""start in a tavern"" way of starting campaigns, I'm starting my campaign in an Ice Cream shop. I kinda expect that they will order ice cream, talk amongst themselves, some NPCs will come over and talk to them, and just things that people do in the tavern but with a modern twist. 

* I want some normal ice cream flavors (like chocolate and stuff), but also some magic-related flavors. Idk, like Silver Honey &amp; Devilberry Ice Cream. I'm designing an actual menu for my players.
* What type of people would you see in a magical ice cream shop? In a tavern, you might have the secret bounty hunter on one shady corner and the jolly bard dancing on tables in the middle of a crowd. What is the Ice cream shop equivalent of those?

**Elder wand**

This ancient wand from long ago has traveled all throughout Brondor and has been given many names like the *death stick* and the *wand of the death mage*. 

Legend states that the elder wand was crafted by the daughter of Th√∂r, Manw√´ the goddess of death and Hel herself after she plucked a branch from a barren and parched elder tree. In legend, it is stated that his wand was originally given to a human sorcerer named Antioch Peverell after he defied Manw√´ and therefore death herself.

This deadly yet brilliant wand gained a reputation through the ages of Brondor, as it was thought to defy death, this caused deaths and wars over the wand that have made the wand move to and fro in Brondor and leave a bloody trail splattered across the pages of its history.

This 15-inch wand is shaped to have a smooth unadorned shaft and handle formed from two conjoined spheres.

It is thought that to become the owner and master of this wand one must disarm or even; kill its owner.

When someone has done this the wand will become attached and tied to its owner they will become attuned allowing the user to concentrate and amplify spells through it.

The wand has 6 charges, each charge allows spells up to level 6 to be cast through it at their lowest level and not require a spell slot.

they are also amplified to deal +2 to damage rolls. If the spell fails the charge is still used.

While holding the wand, your spell save DC increases by 1

Cantrips do not work and it regains 1d6 charges at dawn daily.

The wand is sentient and will speak to whichever wielder is using it in faint snake-like whispers, if the user is not its master it will inflict 4d6 psychic damage after each spell used and will slowly drive the user insane, inflicting one level of madness onto the user after each spell.

The wand will also prevent any damage to be inflicted on its master through it, meaning that if anyone fires a spell with it against its master the spell will instantly fail, and the wand starts to chip after every spell used.",1
DnD,Smashed_Pumpkin86,0,"Table top RPG adventure framework - work in progress Hi, I thought I would share a project I'm currently working on; It's an adventure framework / battle+adventure map system for table top role-playing. So far I'm just making some proof of concept tiles but I have some big plans coming up.

[Village Tavern WIP](https://preview.redd.it/ols5rjer7c051.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0d04bc59c40a2e6108b792ef2e72f5f04430c3)

The goal is to make a streamlined tool for building and playing adventures while having minimal tech related ""fiddling"" during sessions. I love some of the DMing tools out there but all too often the session can stall because of overly complex interfaces or unnecessarily bloated features. I've always been more of a theatre-of-the-mind kind of DM but recently I've gotten back into miniature painting and would like to start using minis in D&amp;D. This drove me to start a project to make a tool which keeps the agile flexibility of a tool-lite game while also providing rich visuals to further kindle and unite imaginations.

DnD,MindOfAProphet,7,"Need help with a one-shot I've been DMing for not very long. I've run a couple of one-shot modules, just finished up LMoP, and running that into PotA now. I'm trying to set up a few one-shots for when I've got spare evenings or if I'm missing several players for a session. I've got a bunch of modules saved but I'd like to make one up myself.

I've got some cool ideas, but I don't know how to execute them properly or ensure they're balanced correctly for PCs levels, etc.

One example I thought of would be an evil-ish one shot where you're cultists trying to free a captured dragon from the castle/princess. 

Any tips you can give would be much appreciated, thanks!",1

DnD,Killtasticles,6,"Need some DM advice Hey DM's, Relatively 'baby' DM here, been DMing for my friends for about 2 years now but I've only ever handled 1 Campaign at a time. I've DMed for a couple of smaller groups 3-4 ppl usually not doing something longer than a 10 session campaign because of school. 

Now it's summer and I really wanted to try the 'Waterdeep Dragonheist' Campaign with one of the groups. The only problem is two of them are very interested and I don't wanna play favorites. Have any of you ever run two of the same campaign for a group of people? I'm worried It will start to get confusing managing two separate parties but, both going on the same adventure?

Any of you have any 'horror' stories attempting something like this? Any tips? Or should I just plan a different adventure for one of the groups?

My biggest concern for running these two games is one of the groups has more seasoned DND players who I know will be more likely to commit to a longer Story, and the other group has more Vanilla players (All in school) So there's a chance they will get busy. I just finished running them through Sunless Cidatel recently, and they were hoping to get something a bit more 'tricky and adventure heavy'?",1

DnD,SharpShogun,7,"So, I stole from my party, buuuuuut... So, I play a moon elf thief (level 4) and our party was a little diminished, our assassin, druid and fighter hadn't pitched up. It was just our dwarf cleric (Adric), myself (Daelias) and a new guy that was a friend of the DM and myself (Rexel).

Luckily this adventure was in a small city, so our DM said that the missing players had been arrested (our druid was insane, our assassin was an assassin and our fighter hit anything that moved, so it was understandable). Adric had done some shady ritual in an earlier version that ended up with him being hated by his god, making it so that not only could he not cast spells, but whenever he tried to, rather than the intended effect, lightning would strike randomly (this often hit him). He was basically useless. 
Rexel was basically a druid that had gotten himself stuck as an ostrich. 

Basically, hijinx insues, including Adric burning down an inn, Rexel eating a magic fruit that makes him fly and me riding said flying ostrich around the city. We end up finding a couple of rival stores, who I think were are both offering some resurrectory items in exchange for something the other store had. Adric's player is smart so he successfully bargains and gets the loot. 

Then he pulls out his crossbow in one of the stores and shoots Rexel, killing him, since our DM said that he would come back to life in his non-bestial form while I was off sightseeing, so I couldn't know this. Daelias is chaotic good, and Adric neutral, so I instinctively think that he's about to commit armed robbery. I decided to steal all the rest of his bolts, secretly, and succeeded. To my surprise, Adric points the crossbow at himself and pulls the trigger. DM says that he appears to have lost his bolts. He says ""oh well"" and proceeds to beat himself to death with his own mace. Turns out that the DM had also said that Adric could gain favour with another god if he was killed and resurrected.


TLDR: My good rogue steals our neutral cleric's crossbow bolts to prevent him from killing innocents. Cleric proceeds to smash his own head with a mace to get his magic back.",1

We play 5e with content that gets given to us each week, and due to the current nature of the business model I don't get to know what group of kids I'll be playing with going into it.

As they are kids and not all of them have the PHB I need to remind a lot of them how to properly use their abilities and what strategies they should employ- reminding the Barbarian that running in head first IS the smart thing to do, letting the Wizard know he might help his team more with Faerie Fire then he will with Shatter, etc.

I feel like I understand how to help these kids with the exception of anyone playing Monk.

They consistently have worse AC and HP then any other melee-oriented class, and their only consolation is the baseline two attacks per turn, but they still get outdamaged by better classes all the time.

My solution up until this point has been having monsters ignore Monks ""just because""- but some kids called me out on it last week and the Monk in the party was pretty bummed when he realized I was ""going easy on him.""

I've heard the advice before that Monks should play like Rogues but that just seems impossible- Rogues get sneak attack every round and can mitigate damage by hiding on a bonus action. Monks need to use their bonus action to unarmed strike so their damage isn't glaringly lower than Fighters and the like.

So how should I be counseling my young monks to play so they don't feel left behind?

DnD,nota-weeb,33,"[3.5] Gotta slay the BBEG!! [pls i really wanna help everybody out] Hello everybody!

I'm here to ask some hardcore consueling since the last session of the campaign is approaching!

In a couple weeks my group and I are going to play the last session of a campaign that lasted more than two years, everybody is fired up and I don't really want to ruin everything because has already happened a couple times: when I messed up, or rather I didn't do everything I could, the result was that even if we won the others had to cover for me so they weren't able to do what they wanted (maybe it didn't even bother them but I was kinda disappointed in myself). I'm not a newbie anymore (or at leat that's what I like to think), I started playing when I joined the campaign ""Strade Oscure"" (Im italian) almost two years ago with them but all of them are veteran and some have been playing DnD for more than 15 years.

That's why today I'm here, I'm humbly asking a little help for preparing before the encounter and some tips during the battle beacause I want to support them in the best way I can. So if anyone is willing to help me out or even just leaave a comment or cheer up a little is more than welcome.

I'll explain a little of context:

We are going to (attempt to) defeat **Azrael**, the mastermind who is plannig to destroy the balance in the Material Plane by erasing everything that's not neutral. That's right he is a very True Neutral (and this is where a lot of problems already come up since alignment-based spells won't work on him). Right now we were able to reach him in the damiplane that he created to do his evil... i mean ""neutral"" stuff. We raided his tower and defeted all the floors but the last one where he lies. (We went trough a lot of hardship, we even  had to defeat the Balor, ouchies).

We don't know much about him, but we do know he:

* is of elven kinship.
* uses arcane magic (probably archwizard, or something similar).
* has a very strong familiar (famiglio in italian I don't know the exact translation): we hit him with severl lightnings and was barely scratch. BTW its a crow.
* is powerd up by at least two artifacts (we might have disabled one of them tho).
* He is somehow able to stack many contingency spells to defend himself and attack at the saame time
* he might not be alone.

This is what we are instead (:   

* **Crusadier** (gets kicked a lot )
* **Rogue** (kicks asses even more)
* **Bard** (his build is frickin OP no kidding, but the PG (not the player) is too stupid to do exploit it, I love him)
* **Alchemist** (not too sure bout the class but it's like a wizard with divine magic)
* **Druid** (pretty standard build)
* **Cleric** (me)

Please note that we are all *level 16 ,* you should also know that we have accsess to all of the official manuals (3.5 edition), but I tend to stick to PHB and Spell Compendium because there are just too many.

This is my PG, and since I know it has quite a lot of potential (since the others helped me build it) I get angry at myself even more for not being able to exploit it well (the exact opposite of the bard):

I'm a **Cleric 13/Sovereign Speaker 3** thus my divine magic lvl is 15, my domains are: Healing, Travel, Time, Luck and Magic (tho we just levelled up so i'm still a bit flexible). As you see my spell list is quite wide and I can do almost anything since i can cast lvl 8 spells (1+1 domain). Other things worth mentioning are that I have Metamagic(Fast Spells) though i can only use it once and I have an Abjuration Rod, and quite a lot of diamond dust (like more than I'll ever need). 

This is what I came up with so far for prep:

1. Death Ward
2. Permanence (lv 5 spell from time domain)  on detect magic(?)
3. Maybe Mark of Demence, but I'm not sure since I can only imagine how high his spell resistence is.
4. Increase the group Spell Resistence, but I'm not sure if it's going to be effective
5. I'd like something to buff everybody, I havemany options so I'm still uncertain which one to choose.

Tactics are more difficult to plan since other membars are taken into account but i was thinking about:

1. Contingency (lv 4 spell)&gt; revivify or dimension door or (mass) restoration
2. I've got a pool of healing (lv 4 spell exchanged)
3. Antimagic-field is probably the only effective way to stop his spells, it would be nice to confine him inside it.
4. During the fight I will basically be encharged in not to let my friends die, so i will be costantly casting healig spells while the others kick and get kicked.

I guess this is enough lol, I can't thank you enough for even just reading so far. Please leave a note if you'd like and ask any questions!

And all of you, please take care meeting up to play DnD certanly is fatastic but stay safe.",1

DnD,lendalvaro,14,"Great Damage or Great Utility? I¬¥m playing as an dragonborn fighter cavalier in 11th level, probably getting to 15th, my party already has a great damage dealer ranger, and a mighty paladin with ""defender"" and ""shield master"", my character aren¬¥t far from them in power, but I see that I could do much more in damage. My char always try to fight mounted but for some versatility I was planing on taking polearm master and drop the lance to fight with a halberd. But then, the DM gave us some special itens, mine let me use find greater steed to conjure a wind drake, so I think he's planing on giving a lot of options for mounted combat.

My character sheet:

Str: 21 (giant belt)

Dex: 14

Con: 18

Int: 8

Wis: 10

Char: 12

Feats: Mounted Combatant

Now, I don't know what to do, I have the biggest ac (the Paladin has 21), but I can drop it from 22 to 20, getting polearm master, and then try to get to GWM at 14th level to get in the same dps as other players, or take feats like ""tought"" and ""alert"" or ""lucky"", and even ""shield master"" too for greater utility and tanking and the option to fight with lots of diferent weapons, but having lance as the principal choice.

I know that with the paladin's ac I can fly of and use my cavalier features to defend myself and my mount while flying trought the map, but I don't know if it is the best option.

DnD,Psychomaniac14,2,"So, you want to maximise your AC? (5e Guide) I know who you are. You're the guy that always tries to act cool but always dies due to being targeted by the enemies. You want that to never happen again, yes? Well then, follow my guide and stop at whatever point you feel comfortable at. It's gonna be a long ride if you want to advance far.

# Step 1 - Making your character

Not every race is suitable for maximum AC. Nor is every class. You can choose any background and still get the final result though, so don't worry about that. Now, let's start. First thing's first, you're gonna want to choose either the Shifter, Simic Hybrid or Warforged race. Each of these 3 races provide a +1 bonus to AC. I personally recommend Warforged, because for Shifter you need the Beasthide subrace and you need to be shifted, and for Simic Hybrid you need to choose the Carapace animal enhancement at level 5. Next, choose the Barbarian class. Trust me, 10+Dex+Con+shield (if you have one) is the best possible base AC. Put your highest stat in Constitution, and your second highest in Dexterity. If you were lucky enough to get 2 18s, your AC should already be 19 from the +2 Con from the race ASI. Also, you should have an Intelligence score of at least 13. As for starting equipment, just make sure you have two one-handed weapons.

# Step 2 - The early game (levels 1-5)

The first thing you should do once you actually start playing as your warforged barbarian is buy a shield. You won't be using it later, but the +2 AC will help for now. Once you hit level 2, start putting all your levels into Artificer. This is what you needed the 13 Int for. Once you hit level 3 and put your second level in Artificer, get the Enhanced Defense infusion and infuse your shield with it. The +1 AC is useful, and this infusion **will** be used for the maximum possible AC. I also recommend getting replicate magic item - bag of holding. It's just super useful. Next, when you hit level 4 and get your Artificer subclass, get the Battle Smith subclass. I recommend Battle Smith for non-AC reasons, but also you **need** it for maximum AC at the minimum level. When you hit level 5, use your ASI to get the Dual Wielder feat. I know, you can't have a shield and two one-handed weapons, but this problem will be bypassed later. Last but not least, make sure you get a Cloak of Protection for that sweet, sweet, free +1 AC. You should now have an AC of 23 if you're using a shield or 21 if you're dual-wielding weapons.

# Step 3 - The mid game (levels 6-10)

Welcome to the mid game. You're gonna get a lot of stuff not related to increasing your AC here, and a few things that are related. Level 6, Extra Attack if you chose Battle Smith. Level 7, Tool Expertise and more infusions. Get Replicate Magic Item - Wand Sheath. It's super useful, and will be used for maximum AC. Level 8, Flash of Genius. Level 9, ASI. Get the Defensive Duelist feat. Yes, I know, Defensive Duelist can't be used for ranged attacks, but maximum AC doesn't require 3/4 cover, funnily enough. Level 10, specialist feature. If you're extra lucky, you would've gotten the Banner of the Krig Rune. If you did, use the Gift of Battle feature on your base so that you have a +1 AC there. Yes, this destroys the banner, but no other part of it gives extra AC. You should now have an AC of 24 if you're using a shied and you're in the range of Gift of Battle.

# Step 4 - The late game (levels 11-15)

Congratulations, you're past the halfway mark for the end of levels without homebrew! Give yourself a pat on the back, because now we're gonna continue increasing your Artificer level. Level 11, you can attune to an extra item! Incredible! Also, if you don't already have a Cloak of Protection, you can now make one with an infusion! Also, remember your shield? The one with the Enhanced Defense infusion? Yeah, now the Enhanced Defense infusion gives +2 AC, not +1. And, if you don't want to use an infusion to make a Cloak of Protection and want to make it normally, it now takes a quarter of the time and half the cost. You can also do this to just make any other common or uncommon magic item and sell it for a profit at full price. Debt? Zero! Anyway, getting back on topic... Level 12, store spells in items. Not used for maximum AC, but still pretty useful. Level 13, ASI. Now you can get that +2 to Dex for the extra +1 AC. Level 14, 4th-level spells and nothing else. Level 15, you can attune to another extra item! Incredible! You can also make Bracers of Defense and a Ring of Protection for +3 AC total, but only Bracers of Defense if you don't wanna use the shield, but you still get Dual Wielder's +1 AC from that, so it's only -1 AC overall if you use Bracers of Defense. Anyway, if you're super lucky, you got an Animated Shield, which means you can throw away your old shield and move the Enhanced Defense infusion to your Animated Shield. I mean, it doesn't say you *can't* put Enhanced Defense on magical armor or a magical shield. By the way, the Ring of Protection won't be used for maximum AC, unless you prefer it over the Cloak of Protection, but why would you? The cloak is way cooler. Anyway, getting back on topic again... If you're even luckier, you would've gotten a Staff of Power, for another +2 AC. You should now have an AC of 29 if you're in the range of Gift of Battle, or 30 if the Animated Shield is also animated and you're wielding two one-handed weapons. Incredible!

# Step 5 - The end game (levels 16-20)

We're in the end game now, so here is where we're reaching the end of levels without homebrew. Level 16, specialist feature. Level 17, ASI. Put it wherever you want, you already have 20 Dex and 20 Con. If you don't because you didn't roll 2 18s for stats, use it to increase your Dex and/or Con. Level 18, 5th-level spells and nothing else. Level 19, you can attune to an extra item! Fanastic! We're finally at the maximum of 6 items you can attune to at once. **Level 20**, go put a level in Cleric or Sorcerer, but if you choose Sorcerer, pick the Divine Soul subclass. What? You're surprised that we stopped at level 18 artificer? Well, level 19 is another ASI and level 20 is just bonuses to saving throws and ability to survive longer if you hit 0 hit points, so it's not really worth it going for the ASI, and definitely not worth it giving up Barbarian 1 for more surviving if you hit 0 hit points. I mean, you shouldn't be hitting 0 hit points! And if you didn't take Barbarian for unarmored defense, you would've had to spend time getting armour that gives you AC 20. Sure, you could've gone for AC 21 with +3 breastplate/16+ Dex/Medium Armor Master or +3 plate, but the breastplate option would've meant getting +3 breastplate and getting another feat you could've used for an ASI or a better feat ***cough*** **Lucky** ***cough***, and the plate option would've meant getting +3 plate. Anyway, why Cleric or Divine Soul Sorcerer? Shield of Faith, that's why. Also if you chose Alchemist for the Artificer subclass, Shield. Also, your proficiency bonus is +6, so Defensive Duelist is better than Shield for melee attacks. If you were super lucky, you would've gotten a Defender in the form of a finesse sword, for up to +3 AC if you attack. Adding up all the regular and situational boosts, you should now have an AC of 41. If you want to continue, this is gonna get super hard and I wouldn't recommend it unless you want the maximum AC just to show off to everyone.

# Step 6 - The epic levels (levels 21-27)

If you want to go further, you're going to need the most co-operative DM ever. Nothing short of being the DM yourself will let you get the maximum AC, but if you're fine with stopping sooner, then just hope your DM will let you go above level 20. Alright then, now we begin the epic levels! Levels 21-23, Wizard. Pick the Bladesinger subclass. Levels 23-29, Ranger. Pick the Hunter subclass, and get the Multiattack Defense defensive tactic. That +4 AC is really nice, but you gotta get hit first. As if that would happen XD. By now, your proficiency bonus is +9. Anyway, that was the easy part.

# Step 7 - The epic levels part 2 - Artifacts, Sentient Items, Ability Score Increases and Blessings

Welcome to the final step, and by far the hardest. First things first, use Ability Score Increases to get 30 Dex, 30 Con and 30 Int. Next, get the gods to recognise your efforts and get the Blessing of Protection for a permanent +1 AC. Next, the items. The hardest part of this procedure. But we'll start off with the easy ones. One Potion of Speed and one Shield Spell Scroll. This is why Shield is important even though you're gonna use your reaction for Defensive Duelist. Now, the actually hard part of the items. Moonblade, Orrery of the Wanderer, Wand of Orcus. Why these 3 items? Moonblade because if it has the right runes, it can be one better than the defender, but the defender is still better than the staff of power, so yeet that out of your collection. The runes you need for the Moonblade are 3x +1 bonus, minor beneficial property rune and hope like hell the minor beneficial property is +1 AC, and defender rune. Yep, that's two defenders you're using, but slightly better. The Orrery of the Wanderer is an artifact which gives a +1 to AC and can, you guessed it, have a minor property that gives +1 AC. The Wand of orcus is an artifact which gives an entire +3 to AC and can, you guessed it, have a minor property that gives +1 AC. Put it in the Wand Sheath from earlier so you can use it without actually holding it.

# The true value for the maximum AC, with calculations

1. Barbarian Unarmored Defense w/ 30 Dex and 30 Con (AC 30)
2. Warforged (+1, AC 31)
3. Shield of Faith (Concentration spell that gives +2 AC, AC 33)
4. Multiattack Defense (+4 AC if hit by a creature and attacked again by them in the same turn, AC 37)
5. Defensive Duelist (+9 AC due to +9 proficiency bonus, AC 46)
6. Dual Wielder (+1 AC, AC 47)
7. Animated Shield w/ Enhanced Defense infusion (+4 AC, AC 51, first attunement)
8. Banner of the Krig Rune - Gift of Battle (+1 AC, AC 52)
9. Cloak of Protection (+1 AC, AC 53, second attunement)
10. Defender (+3 AC, AC 56, third attunement, first hand, attack action first attack)
11. Moonblade (+1 AC from minor property, +3 AC from defender property, AC 60, fourth attunement, second hand, attack action second attack)
12. Orrery of the Wanderer (+1 AC, +1 AC from minor property, AC 62, fifth attunement)
13. Potion of Speed (+2 AC, AC 64, lets you do an extra action)
14. Shield Spell Scroll (+5 AC, AC **69**, used during the extra action granted by the Potion of Speed)
15. Wand of Orcus (+3 AC, +1 AC from minor property, AC 73, sixth attunement)
16. Wand Sheath (lets you get the extra AC from the Wand of Orcus without holding it in your hand, shared sixth attunement)
17. Blessing of Protection (+1 AC, AC 74)
18. Bladesong w/ 30 Int (+10 AC, AC 84)

You can go higher, but that would require others casting spells on you and more levels. Every 4 levels after 29, your proficiency bonus goes up by 1, so have fun with getting infinite levels!

Thank you for reading my guide. Have a good day! Post any other ideas for getting higher AC without homebrew in the comments.",1

DnD,Bestermann1996,11,"Poison Spray [Variant] thoughts on balance and comparisons to other cantrips.  **The Spell:**

Level: Cantrip

School: Conjuration

Casting Time: 1 Action

Range/Area: Self (10 ft Cone)

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

&amp;#x200B;

You extend your hand forward and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. Each creature in a 10-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts:**

Comparison to ""Acid Splash"" and ""Toll the Dead"". 

Acid Splash: Target 2 creatures in range (60 feet) which must be within 5 feet of each other. Dex save for 1d6 acid damage.

Toll the Dead: Target 1 creature in range (60 feet). Wis save for 1d8 necrotic damage or missing hitpoints 1d12 necrotic damage.

In my opinion the often immune/resisted damage type poison needs a cantrip competitor.

Con saving throw and no damage on save balance the area effect, which in practice would max target 2 creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

With little playtesting done myself, I ask for reasond arguments/modifikations for this alteration of Poison spray.

Thanks in advance for your constructive criticism.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello hive mind! I need help with an issue that me and another player are having while in curse of Strahd.

We're playing in a heavy role play style of game and have been encouraged by our DM to write backstories and role play our characters. The characters with the issues are: a (me)dragonborn necromancer, who believes the soul is sacred but not the body (will raise dead but will not mess with their souls), and a (my gf)teifling ranger whose entire clan was dedicated to destroying undead.

Currently the ranger has had the mindset of my character being the ""lesser evil"", Strahd being the main ""greater evil"", which we are aiming to defeat. Which is why she hasn't attacked me, and is begrudgingly working with me, but the further I move down the necromancer path the less likely her character will see mine as the lesser evil. We don't want to cause any PvP but we want to have our characters behave true to how we originally created them.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to hear all of your thoughts on this issue, we've spoken to the DM and have a few ideas but more ideas wouldn't hurt.",1

DnD,Kyle_Dornez,4,"New Genie UA Parton and Demiplane spell. I've been mulling around with a warlock concept with new released UA - genie patron seems very thematic for a genasi warlock, but unfortunately genasi suck for warlocks - and I've noticed that Demiplane spell is class one for Warlocks. Especially considering that Genie warlocks get their Bottled Respite feature. But then I've actually read the description, I believe it would be okay to copypaste it here:

&gt; **Bottled Respite.**   
&gt;  
&gt;As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a **20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high**, and resembles your vessel. The interior is comfortably appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature.  

While the Demiplane is: 

&gt;**Demiplane**   
&gt;  
&gt;You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room **30 feet in each dimension**, made of wood or stone. 

So... basically, a Genie Warlocks get's effect of an 8th-level spell that is just a bit less on space AND has furniture. 

And it's not a knock on Genie Warlocks - it's a knock on Demiplane spell, what the hell is with it? It's 8th level! And you tell me I can't even do shit with it, like set the decorations, or make it grow like almost every previous version of the spell? 

Like, connect it to the Bottled Respite space and make it grow into a magnificient genie palace? Wtf.",1

However the best part is the repeating shot infusion alchemist artificers(maybe all idk?) can put on a weapon. So now i have a grenade launcher that does 5d6 piercing damage that reloads automatically with unlimited ammo.
It wasn‚Äôt my intention initially when creating this character to go this route and i honestly didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd actually work, but after some out of game discussion with my gm he admitted that it all had checked out. (Btw my gnomes int is 20, it‚Äôs his only good stat but it‚Äôs all that matters) with his int and background i got the greenlight to keep and use his creation. But i literally blew the first encounter to smitherines due to all 3 creatures being within 20 feet of each other.",1

DnD,RowbotMaster,1,"[5e] looking for advice on a set of combining magic items So the idea of these items is that they started out as a single magic item that was broken apart and the PCs can put them back together

The individual items I have in mind are:

A moon-touched greatsword

2 pearls of power(actually onyx that are meant to be fitted to the guard of the sword)

And a wand of fireballs(actually a greatsword pomel)

And they combine into a +2 flame tongue greatsword theoretically it should be at about very rare.

My plan is that the gems will each add +1 to the weapon and the pomel adds the flame tongue aspect and the fire damage will be reduced if it has less than full charges.

I've already given my players the greatsword but I'm thinking that I'd like to have the +1 greatsword be an attunement item.

Is there an ability that is should have such as possibly being able to make the light turn on or off at will or as a bonus action?",1

DnD,shoe_owner,21,"Returning 2nd, 3rd and 4th ed player looking for some advice on creating his first 5th ed character. So, I've played D&amp;D off and on for decades, but split off to Pathfinder when 4th edition wasn't to my tastes. I've recently been invited to a 5th edition game run by a good friend of mine, and while I've been brushing up on the core rulebook (which all seems pretty solid and intuitive to me), I know that the game system has been out for years now, with by now doubtless dozens of expansions and whatnot, such that I don't quite know where to start looking for what I have in mind. 

I had a character I played for a bit in Pathfinder whose concept I really enjoyed and I'd like to see what exists in D&amp;D 5th edition which would suit the same concept and general vibe, so to speak, and I'd like to seek out some advice for books, classes, etc which seem to suit what I'm looking for, at least in broad terms. A starting point, anyway. 

The concept, in a nutshell: A brutish, hugely intimidating former pirate who fell in love with a decent and honourable woman ashore, and who has decided to leave his lawless ways in the past in order to be worthy of her love, seeking out lawful-and-if-possible heroic work as a mercenary. He retains all of his menacing piratical skills and habits, but attempts to ply them in more righteous way. 

Systematically, in Pathfinder I'd just absolutely maxed out everything I could relating to using the intimidation skill in combat. Various combinations of feats which allowed him to put on terrifying displays to demoralize and shake his enemies with grandiose displays of martial prowess, bloodthirsty screams and whatnot. Obviously combat-wise, something rather swashbuckly is in order, and I presume that there's classes which support that. I'd be most comfortable playing him as a martial class, though obviously there's a case to be made for some sort of fighter/rogue multiclass type of deal. I'm open to ideas here. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if it's only ""Yeah, get this book and read this section, you might find something that's along the lines of what you're talking about.""",1

Premise:
Party enters an abandoned cursed manor, eventually revealed to be the lair of a lich. Within the manor are the spirits of others that have entered and since passed away their spirits trapped within eventually losing all substanceand existing as shadows with no substance in the shape of men. Four spirits that still retain some semblance of substance request the party sit and allow them to relive their lives in the stories of their memories. When listening to their stories the party will find themselves actually within the memories and interacting with and witnessing the events. These remaining spirits will have once been friends and a party with a wizard now turned lich that resides in the manor. And within their memories and stories are clues and details that may lead to finding the lich and ending the curse releasing the party and the trapped souls.

DnD,Lexi_Banner,0,"[OC] Fleshing out corruption in a church If you have just had your ass kicked by the Ember Servant, away with you!  Go on!!  Git!

*(For the record, my plans to run this plague style plot arc started way back in summer 2019 - it's playing out creepily similar to real life, which was not something I ever anticipated!)*

In my game, I've had a town go into Martial Law because there is a creature in the catacombs that has caused enough death and chaos that no one is allowed to go into the catacombs, not even to bury the dead. Being that it is a large city, people are still regularly dying, and being unable to dispose of them properly has caused disease to run rampant - it is about to turn into a plague if it isn't sorted out.

The players have learned that the creature is the Ember Servant, who was a champion of the god of light (Dabog, in my campaign). His reliquary was stolen, and he has returned as a vengeful force to seek justice for the wrong. At the end of the last game, the players were all downed except two, and they were at single digit HP - the light cleric in the party pleaded for the Ember Servant to let them right the wrong, and barely squeaked out a persuasion check.

Part of the entire plot is that the church itself is responsible for the theft because they saw their attendance dropping further and further. But what brings about higher attendance than a healthy dose of existential fear? The problem is, they didn't realize that the Ember Servant would (1) come back at all, and (2) be so terribly violent. They also didn't anticipate how quickly the disease would spiral out of control and that Martial Law would be instated, hamstringing their efforts to increase attendance.

Now, my problem is that next session they are going to try and find the reliquary or to stop the High Cleric's actions in an attempt to appease the Ember Servant. I've already told the players in previous interactions with this cleric that he feels as though the actions they've taken to stop the Ember Servant are enough, although their response has really been to lock down the catacombs.

How would you flesh out this particular plot arc? I'd like it to have some political intrigue (it's been suggested that other churches are in on it as well), and I don't mind the idea of a caper, but I want it to feel relatively serious - because if they don't succeed in this, the Ember Servant will not be satisfied, and will continue to wreak havoc, which will then push this into full-on plague territory because they cannot transport the dead outside of the city fast enough (at the foot of a mountainous region, to be able to properly bury the dead they need to travel three hours away).

Several sessions ago as we were getting to a stopping point, we came across an ogre right before getting to the place we were going to make camp.

Our human fighter interrupts him and says ""I was actually hoping to talk to him instead of just jumping into a fight"" (the ogre wasn't aggressive or threatened. We failed our stealth check, he saw us and that's what ogres do). The DM thought and said decided to allow it. The fighter and myself (elf ranger) have a short conversation with the ogre where at some point we convince him that his club is inferior and he should give it to us to get it repaired (dm claimed he thought the whole thing was hilarious and let us take it).

DnD,Garrick_Redroot,2,"Back End Initiative: an alternative initiative mechanic for 5e. Feedback welcome! * At the start of the game all players roll for initiative and the DM notes everyone‚Äôs rolls.
* The  DM can roll NPC/Monster initiative by using default numbers (grunts are  10, captain 15, etc), OR secretly in real time when the players are  getting close to initiative.
* DM can tack on +5/-5 for adv/disadv to any initiative roll.
* DM calls initiative and combat proceeds RAW.
* A the end of the encounter initiative is re-rolled for the next one.

That's it!

When  initiative is called its already accounted for so that moment of lag  where everyone rolls, the DM takes a minute to write everything down and  slows game momentum never happens. The DM is set if they want to give  players or monsters adv/disadv on the fly so it all flows smoothly.

Possible downsides to this are:

* losing that visceral feeling of literally rolling dice at the moment combat starts
   * may be able to make up for this by doing something theatrical for start of initiative
* players forgetting to have combat turns planned and in their back pocket
   * DM reminders as a scenario starts to get tense might be required to solve this

DnD,missleliz,0,"Tips for Village-Wide Hunting Competition If you‚Äôre part of Codfish - stay away!



So in a long-term campaign I‚Äôm running, the party has come to a village built in the middle of a swap during the weekend of their annual Hunt Festival. The government releases a dangerous monster, and each local shop has a team represent them to participate in the Hunt. Obviously the party convinced one of the shops to sponsor them, and they know the basic rules of the Hunt (1 point for locating the creature, 3 points for each grievous injury paid to the creature (likely any damage in one turn above 40 HP), 10 points for the kill). They also know teams can work together, but most teams hesitate to do so since no one knows who will get the final kill. Winners receive money and prizes, and the sponsoring shop gets subsidies and fame.

The players are level 8, and I‚Äôm designing the creature accordingly. I figure they will do some fighting with other groups (non-lethal) to try to get the upper hand on the monster, and have to make competitive survival checks to see which teams reach it first.

My question for all of you experienced DMs and players out there is what would you add to make the Hunt more challenging and exciting? Any additional mechanics or complications that come to mind?  Any advice for balancing 10+ teams all working to track and kill the same quarry?

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to play ""Out of the Abyss"" and have been planning not only the campaign, but also that it is linked to the backstorys of my players.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Do DemonLords and ArchDevils conflict with each other?

&amp;#x200B;

I say this because basically 2 of my players are linked in some way with an Archdevil.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan without much knowledge of the subject, is that the Archdevil do not want the demonlords to be on the material plane because they are bothered by their future plans. Or they just want to get something out of them by killing them.

&amp;#x200B;

So I would like to know if it makes sense or if I am far from a real justification.",1
DnD,123cyberman,22,"How should I talk this out with my DM To preface, it takes me FOREVER to make a character because i'm super indecisive and picky over what I want. Despite this, I made a character that I thought was interesting. It's basically a kobold hex blade warlock that is usually naive and nice, but when in battle he blacks out and the sword basically takes over (think Zenitsu from Demon Slayer.)

I wanted to know if anyone else playing had this mechanic and he wouldn't answer me (if anyone else had this mechanic then I would change my character \[because I want something really unique to separate me\] which would take me awhile but he wants our characters so he can make a story around us.)

Idk what to do from here. Should I tell him that it won't matter if my tells me (it'll ruin the surprise sure but I dont want to have the same mechanic as someone), or should I just make another character?",1

P.s  Apologies for the lack of flavoring I wanted to add that last to spare some limited brain power.

Counter Strike¬†
When a creature attacks you can spend 2 ki points and roll your martial arts die and subtract it from the attack roll, if the attack misses you can make an attack of opportunity without expending a reaction¬†

Strike and Return
At 6th level you become a master of striking and then quickly escaping whenever you attack a creature on your turn and then provoke an attack of opportunity by the same creature they have disadvantage on the attack roll. If a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you can spend 2 ki points and make 2 attacks instead of one. Strike and Return does not gain the benefit of Counter Strike¬†

Use Momentum¬†
At 14th level Whenever you miss an attack on a creature you can spend 2 ki points and as a reaction make an attack on a separate creature and on a hit you can spend an additional ki point and move up to half your speed. If you move to a different creature you may make an attack against them

Starting at 17th level whenever you hit a creature with Counter Strike you can spend 5 ki points to give the creature disadvantage on all attacks until the end of your next turn as you quickly strike its nerves",1

DnD,lavjah,3,"Some Character Ideas I've been in quarantine for a while and have been just making a few characters in my head, so it will be nice to put it on paper and maybe inspire a few others.

1) Lee Jones, Human, fighter, Gunslinger, Folk Hero.
Lee Jones is a bounty hunter. He is a quiet man who freed a local town from a team of thugs who stole from the town.

Now Lee walks to land, looking for evil to be crushed. Lee is more a force of nature than a man. He disappears and reappears when needed.

2) Spot Liamen, Tabaxi, Bard College of Swords or Rouge Swashbuckler, Folk hero or entertainer 

A charismatic, sweet talking Cat, that has fast hands for his guitar but also fast hands for his Rapier. He loves the life of adventure. He loves milk and his only goal is to find his long lost love, Citrus. 

3) Sprigs Willyfield, Human, Magic Intiate, Undead Warlock(Lv 1), Wizard Divination (Lv2)
Sprigs was training under a wizard who travelled the sand wastes in search of old ruins and artifacts.

During an expedition to go search for an ancient artifact in a dungeon, Sprigs got lost and trapped in a series of underdark cave systems. He tried to walk these caves blindly, but as the time turned from days, to weeks, to months, Sprigs felt the presence of some other being. A dark sinister being. And as he was on the brink of death from starvation, a lich brought him his life back, in return for his eyes.

Sprigs is now blind but he can see, not from his eyes but with magic. Now he walks the desert wastes looking for more power, something to return his eyes, but every attempt to fix his eyes is taken away by his patron. So it's a never ending battle against his curse.

4) Human, Rouge Inquisitive, Prodigy feat, Kensai monk, make your monk weapon a Whip, Take the Archeologist Background.

DnD,DevBuh,6,"Homwbrew rules and changes to adapt Avatar The Last Airbender to 5e We've been running one shots of different scenarios in the avatar world via 5e dnd and developed a few homebrew rules to make it feel more fluid combat wise, I wanted to share it since  I have seen a number of folks talk about mixing the avatar setting with 5e

The normal stat rollout is still applied alongside the new stats

All benders start at lvl 1 6hp+1d6+con modifier worth of hit points, non benders in these scenarios can be summed up as fighters from 5e

Fire benders get a plus 1 to defence, as well as a +1 to intelligence and wisdom which are also their bending modifiers, their special ability is lightning

Earth benders get a plus 3 to their hp as well as +1 constitution and strength, con and str are their bending modifiers, their special ability is metal bending

Water benders get a plus 1 to ki, as well +1 dexterity and charisma, which are also their bending modifiers, their special ability is plant or blood bending

Air benders get a plus 1 to stamina and ki, as well as a +1 to dexterity which is their bending modifier, their special ability is atmospheric

‚òÜall benders will have different skill levels but we have summed it into 3 levels, apprentice, adept, and master, apprentices have mastered 3 basic technuiqes in which they can proficency to, adepts have learned 2 advanced moves alongside their 3 basic moves, and a master has combined his previous knowledge into 1 ultimate move, these moves can be chained into combinations based on how much ki you have for different results

Basic moves-require simple motions and don't use an excessive amount of energy 1d4

Adept moves-require more timed and trained movements that channel energy proportionally to the move 1d6

Master moves-requires mental and physical balance alongside perfected body motions to releash an amazing amount of energy 1d8


Defence - You now have defence, defence is a hit block and as long as you have some remaining you can choose to block an attack for half the incoming damage, defence is based on your str modifier, if your defence drops to 0 in the same turn as an attack you're knocked prone

Ki- ki determines your ability to bend the elements in combination attacks or abilities, a higher ki means more combinations, every bender starts at 1, Ki is based on your bending elements specific stat bonus

Stamina- stamina replaces your ac as a bender, it determines how capable you are at avoiding and redirecting attacks away from yourself, unlike defence you cannot activate your stamina in response to an attack, it simply activates whenever the opponent rolls below your stamina level1

Balancing bending for the homebrew system- when using basic abilities you roll a 1d4 to attempt and best the enemies stamina, if you beat it the enemy may then activate defence for half damage but otherwise cannot avoid the attack, the goal in combinations is to empty an enemies defence and cause them to fall prone, most benders accept defeat once clearly disadvantaged. When using a adept ability you roll a 1d6, and a ultimate ability you roll a 1d8, the better the ability skill wise the more likely it is for you to knock an enemy down in a single combination. ‚òÜIts up to your dm and you to create your specific abilities and their details, limitations, etc. Skills are still applicable to avatar scenarios however proficencies beyond weapons and armor can be forgotten, magic doesnt exist anymore and the only real non bending classes are lvl 0 peasant, bard, and fighter. Use the actual map used in the avatar if you're having trouble establishing a good setting to start in, you can create an entire session of the top of your head!

DnD,StrawberryEiri,0,"Balanced minor power related to wild magic In my game (DnD 5e, characters just turned level 2), a couple of players had ideas for special things they wanted for their character. So I gave them all an opportunity to write a couple of paragraphs about a weak special power or magic item their character could start with. Most players obliged, and here's what we ended up with:

- one has a disabled blinkdog as a familiar even though she's a sorcerer, not a wizard. 
- one has a brooch that can grant him a temporary disguise as another person once a day. However the brooch must be worn on the heart and held in the palm during the whole spell's duration, and it gradually heats up, eventually becoming impossible to hold without injury and terrible wincy faces.
- one's divine symbol/spell focus is tattooed on his body, so he can never be caught without it. 

There's one player (dragonborn Paladin) who never found a fitting idea though. 

The last boss fight was a creature of chaos that triggered wild magic dice rolls with a higher probability of ""explosion"" every round on both the sorcerer and one person chosen at random, which ended up being the Paladin, who would be someone who would find out then and there they had the potential to become a wild magic sorcerer if they so desired. 

Well, despite the sorcerer having twice the chance of triggering that effect plus another chance anytime she cast a spell, she triggered it only once (and with a standard spell roll at that), while the Paladin triggered it three times, including two rounds in a row. 

This gave me an idea that chaos could have left a deep imprint on his character (even though he's a Paladin) and it would give him a permanent minor power of some kind. I want to make sure it isn't vastly more powerful than what the other players have, so I thought I'd ask people who know who they are doing before making a proposal to the player. 

So far, here are my chaos/randomness inspired ideas:

- gain a single sorcerer cantrip to use at will / a limited number of times per rest
- can cast a random sorcerer spell once per rest
- gain the ability to call upon chaos to willingly cause a wild magic d100 roll once per rest

To quote the description of a dugger‚Äôs tome:
&gt; A Duggers tome is a large leather bound book.  Each Duggers tome can only be used once.
If a Duggers Tome is set on any book, it will transform into an exact copy of that book.  From that point on, any adjustments made to either book will be reflected in the other.

So what i am curious is lets say you take one dugger‚Äôs tome and copy a book, then you take another dugger‚Äôs tome and copy the same book or the other dugger‚Äôs tome.

Would that mean that all 3 books were copies of eachother, and thus, able to each be used for writing into the other books?

DnD,askingquestionsblog,8,"Created a new magic item - the Daughterstone - my entire campaign is centered around it, and the character who possesses it doesn't close to know the whole of it... :) What do you think? **Daughterstone**:  Given mother elf to daughter, this stone creates a powerful long-distance bond that is able to be sensed by the person who bestowed it. To do this, a person must separate away some of their life-force, much in the say way that a lich creates a phylactery (or Voldemort creates a Horcrux, but not evil).

While the daughter wears the stone given to her, and the mother wears hers, the mother may be aware (at will) of the daughter‚Äôs general emotional state, general well-being, and physical health. She is immediately made aware, in real time, of any major trauma, or anytime the daughter is brought to or below zero hit points. If the daughter should die, the mother may sacrifice 1 STR, 1 CON, and 1 DEX, permanently, to bring her back to 1 HP. The next time,if there is a next time, the sacrifice required is 2 points each, and so on. This may not reduce any ability score below 3 (ignoring magic). If any ability score would drop below 3, the mother may choose to sacrifice herself entirely to save her daughter one last time. The mother‚Äôs gem will disintegrate and the daughter‚Äôs gem will glow. The daughter will have a vision of her mother‚Äôs sacrifice before awakening, and will gain 1 WIS and 1 CON, but lose 1 CHA, permanently. The daughter‚Äôs gem will then become inert. A gem that has expired in this way may be used to fashion a new stone (given or received); such a gem will confer Advantage to the creator of the new gem for the three rolls necessary to magick it (see below).

To fashion the Daughterstone, there are various rituals known only to the elves, that must be cast over a period of days using a crystalline gem (not a pearl, for example) of at LEAST 500 gp value. During the rituals, the spells *Trap the Soul*, *Detect Thoughts*, and *Resurrection* are cast into the gem. \[ *5e* players: *Trap the Soul* is a ‚Äúreduced‚Äù 7th-level version of the 9th level spell *Imprisonment*; if you have access to Wizard spells, then assume you have access to it for the purposes of creating this item only ‚Äì the spell was officially removed from the PHB and folded into *Imprisonment*. \]  The caster/item creator, not necessarily the mother herself, must roll, modified by his or her spell attack modifier, for *each* of the 3 spells individually:

DC = 20 + level of spell ‚Äì (value of gem in gp)/500

Once successful, the mother must sleep with both the Daughterstone and an *identical* non-magical gem for a number of nights equal to her highest score of STR, DEX, or CON. When she wakes from the final night, she will know ‚Äì she will be fatigued, feel ill, and normal means will not restore her. The feeling will pass by the next day, but she will have surrendered 1 STR, 1 DEX, and 1 CON permanently.

The Daugherstone is now fully magicked, and its companion stone (to be worn by the mother) properly attuned. The Daughterstone may be worn by *any* of-blood daughter of the mother (even if the daughter is not a full elf), and it takes a similar number of days to fully attune to her; there is no sacrifice on the part of the daughter. If either gem is off for a period of time equal or greater to this initial attunement period, *both* gems must be fully re-attuned (this requires a new sacrifice of STR, DEX, and CON), though the spells do not need to be re-cast.

The Daughterstone has as many hit points as the max HP of mother and daughter combined at that moment, is immune to magical and nonmagical fire, cold, and acid, and has resistance to lightning and force damage. It cannot be destroyed by any targeting or area of effect spell of 6th level or lower; this includes lightning and force effects. A dragon‚Äôs (or other creature‚Äôs) lightning breath may affect it (subject to resistance) if the CR of the creature is 13 or higher. The Daughterstone‚Äôs reach will extend into the Astral and Ethereal planes, but not other material planes of existence. During such times, the gems will become non-functional, but as long as they are worn, will not require subsequent re-attunement.

If the Mother dies for reasons other than sacrificing herself to the Daughterstone, the daughter will instantly know, through there is no other effect. If the daughter dies while wearing the stone, and the mother does *not* bring her back with the stone, both stones shatter, and the mother loses 2 CHA permanently.

A Daughterstone has no immediately usable magical value to anyone outside the mother-daughter bond, though such a stone, properly identified for what it is, would be valued at the base cost for a ‚Äúvery rare‚Äù magic item (DMG, p. 130).",1

DnD,RockingRees,11,"Working on a class idea. Need help balancing Way of the Mystic

The Monks of the way of the mystic are trained to fight with and against magic

**Magic Training**

Due to your training in the magical arts at 3rd level, you gain a minor control and knowledge of it. You gain proficiency in Arcana. You also can cast Prestidigitation and one other Wizard cantrip that requires a spell attack or saving throw, in addition you can cast Detect Magic as a ritual. Your spell casting ability for these is Wisdom and the DC is equal to your Ki save DC.

**Ki Blockage**

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level you hit pressure points in magic to attempt to prevent it‚Äôs flow. Whenever you hit a creature with your Flurry of blows the next time it attempts to cast a spell it must succeed a constitution saving throw (against your monk save DC) or be unable to cast the spell. This ability only works on spells equal to half your monk level (to a maximum of 4th)

**Mystic Step**

At 6th level, when you use Step of the Wind to Dash you may instead teleport up to half your movement speed to a place you can see within range.

**Spell Nullification**

Due to your training at 11th level, you can attempt to nullify others' magic to a far greater extent. You can spend 3 Ki points to cast both Counterspell and Dispel Magic at 3rd level. You may spend additional ki points to increase the level of the spell by 1. The maximum number of ki points you may spend equals half your level. 

**Magical Defense**

Your exposure and training with magic has allowed you to create a ward around yourself. You have resistance to all damage from spells. Additionally when you take patient defense you also gain advantage on saving throws against spells.",1

DnD,Stenis_,25,"Break a pact as a warlock **Context:** One of my players has a pact with Asmodeus, well his family has a pact with him. Far back in the warlock's family tree one of them offered the servitude of the entire family bloodline for all of its existence, in exchange for eternal life. Generations go by where one is selected from each generation to serve as a warlock and do Asmodeus bidding, often killing nonbelievers known by the patron. Sometimes though they are sent out to gather information.

We are currently playing Hoard of the Dragon Queen later going to Tyranny of Dragons, where said warlock has infiltrated the cult of the dragon to gather info about the cult's happenings since Asmodeus can't allow Tiamat to break her contract with him.

**The character:** The character is Bevyn Greycastle, human, artisan background (potter). Bevyn is an ordinary man nearing his mid-20s. Raised by a single mother and trained under the apprenticeship of a master potter in Waterdeep. He seeks nothing more than ordinary life. This was quickly pulled away from him though by an imp talking to him about his family contract with Asmodeus. He was then sent away to Greenest and or the cult of the dragon to infiltrate them.

**The Problem:** Bevyn's greatest desire is to rid his family and or him from the contract of Asmodeus. I as the DM see this as quite unlikely but I am desperately trying to find a way Bevyn could maybe break the contract. The characters are currently only level 4 and I am very willing to play the long game on Bevyn since the player in question still wants to play as a warlock. I am trying to think ahead about what could maybe be some options for him in the future.

How does one break a contract with Asmodeus? The lord of lies, Archdevil of Nessus, Ruler of Batoor, and Greater Deity. One of the only options I see in front of me is sacrificing an entire kingdom for the release of Bevyns servitude. Since the character doesn't want another patron breaking the contract in that manner is no option. I really don't know what to do.",1

The player is looking for traps, but there are no traps? if you don't make them roll then every time you do they will know that there are traps, but they won't find traps regardless of the roll if you do.

Do something physically impossible like move a 2 ton statue or jump to the top of a 5 story building.

Do something someone else could do, with a higher bonus, but they definitely can't, like a dc20 check, when they have a -1 to the stat.

Make a saving throw against something that they can't save, once again like the dc20 check, but this time a save, in which they would know they are being targeted, but couldn't save regardless.

Walked in a room, cast mold earth and made a pit beneath a hiding bugbear.
The bugbear succeeded on a check and managed to grapple me, and walk me 20ft over to someone else.
I then used a vocal cantrip of mood earth in front of me, but the mage succeeded and managed to cast hold person on me.
My allies weren‚Äôt allowed to react to any of this before hand, despite being 5ft from me, and it was all out of initiative with no combat.

DnD,whyismynameskippy,52,"Is The DM Always Right? My DM is very good in my opinion. He is a strong world builder and a skilled actor which makes the game immersive and fun. However, I find then sometimes he sort of meta games. For example, our company recently fought and Ice Dragon(we defeated with no casualties... barely). There were times where my DM would do something like have the dragon fly up just 5 feet off the ground do move to attack and character in order to avoid opportunity of attack. To me this strikes me as meta gaming because when was the last time u saw a dragon in a movie or imagined a dragon being mindful of opportunity of attack as opposed to simply wreaking havoc? I challenged my DM during this instance and said that I felt he was meta gamming. I wouldnt call any DM out like this but this DM is a very close friend of mine. What I wanna know is was it ok for me to intervene? Personally I think the DM should be setting an example for the rest of the party by not metagamming and trying to add to the experience. However, if he was simply doing this to try and balance the fight during the event to create a longer and more entertaining encounter maybe i shouldn't have interjected. What are your thoughts?",1

DnD,bradburb,0,"Returning To A Campaign After Hiatus; Broad-Strokes Character Driven One-Shots (X-Post) Recently, during the Covid-19 outbreak, myself and my four favourite players resumed our campaign after a year's hiatus. (nearly as long as we'd been playing 1-2x weekly beforehand)

Two of the Four had moved away, and for the rest of us 3, schedules had become a mess to co-ordinate. We also used to meet in person, so the idea of playing online always seemed uncomfortable and somewhat foreign. We all loved the analog, tactile, and social nature of the game.

  
In short: The campaign:

There's a big war going on between the North and South. Campaign kinda kicked off near the end, with a gigantic airship battle on the Capitol of the North (Galgorath).

2 friends were the original players, they just wanted a one-shot in my West-Marches world, and it turned into a weekly thing from there.

They ended up on this crazy 2 month journey South through a desert with a caravan of gypsies, had to do some secret undercover stuff, and found out where the Prince of Galgorath was being held captive.

Then, on their way to that city, they ran into the other 2 players, who jumped in at level 3. There was some small time political stuff, a town of Tieflings who'd made a deal with a coven of Hags, turned out the whole village was in cahoots to  give them human children, so the players killed the Hags and saved 1 kid, helped get the human family safely away, and then went on a seafaring trip further south. The goal was to find out where the dark blood magic was coming from, that Vorzoth (southern Capitol) was using to fuel airships. They suspected an ancient Dark Elf city.

Turns out that city was held way back technologically, (based on Mayan/ Aztec culture, Ziggurats and Serpent Gods and the like) and were pretty chill. They took a couple months stopping a huge Slaad infestation in the swamps and surrounding jungle, and have been working with them ever since as sort of a base of operations. They've also been in communication via Sending Stone to a group of rebels in the North, led by the old captain of the guard.

One original player, Jack, A blade dancer wizard, has been developing his own magic this whole time. Using ice and mist. Lots of utility. But he's super squishy.

His friend, Nam Fleeht, a Ranger from the Northern forests, found the Slaad spawning stone on a short expedition to Avernus and has been slowly turning more and more Slaad-y, while retaining some semblance of humanity. He also controls a horde of them now, as a substitute for his familiar.

The other players that joined are a Cleric, Elryn, who converted to the temple of Queszelcoatl at the Dark Elf village, and a dragon born monk named Tim who's dumb as a stump but incredible when it comes to Hand to Hand.

&amp;#x200B;

If our campaign had been a 3 act story, we'd left things right at the Rising Action, the climax of Act 2. Every character had found themselves, to a degree, developed ties, had personal conflicts, loss, personal struggles, and most importantly established short and long term goals. Then, the campaign fell apart, as things do when you've got real-world priorities.

Cut to: March. The world is ending, everyone's cooped up in their homes looking for an escape, and it comes to me. Let's brave the world of cyber DND. I'll pour myself into Roll 20 and a custom Discord server much l ike I would with my terrain, maps, world and characters, and we can recap the last year in-game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone was on-board.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I ran a long RP heavy ""Season 2 ep.0"" so we could all figure out just how each character's goals would have transpired, who would have helped, and how, and I gathered ""end goals"". What's the climax of their own personal mission or journey? This was also a good opportunity to familiarize ourselves witht he new platform. (I'll admit, we're all still pretty bummed we can't be around a table together, but 90% of the time it's close enough)

They've scoured the jungles on a hunt for ""the Beast"", a massive Slaad chonky boy for the Hunter to ride. They've returned to Avernus on a Mad Max Fury Road inspired desert chase, to hunt down and kill the last remaining Hag. They visited a God so the Cleric could speak to Queszelcoatl and pledge her allegiance. And now, the final puzzle piece, the wizard has taken the crew to Shadowfell to seek council with the Raven Queen's Mouthpiece and investigate the death of Khala, the Winter Goddess. He wishes to either bring her back, or at least use some sort of relic to channel her powers into the spell he's creating. Tonight, his body is the casting focus for a summoning ritual, and we have no idea how it's going to go...

All this as a lead-up to the finale, a long-awaited, coordinated strike on Vorzoth, and in the middle of all the chaos, an attempted rescue of the Prince (now king) of Galgorath.

&amp;#x200B;

As a DM I've really been enjoying prepping and playing these games. My Players have consistently told me how much they've enjoyed the more ""broad strokes"" style one-shots, Never in one place for too long, missions seem personal and character driven, but also focused and important at all times. The stakes are higher, the accomplishments are greater, and they're making an impact on teh game world on a near hourly basis.

I don't know how sustainable this style of campaign would be to run, but as a recap from a year away, it feels incredible to have everyone experiencing an entirely curated personal session, while at the same time, driving the narrative miles and miles closer to their collective end goal.

If anyone's looking for a good way to pick back up with an old adventuring party, I'd highly recommend this approach.",1

DnD,ASingleQuest,0,"Relatively new, short-form podcast looking for listeners and feedback! Hi there!

In February, the my best buddy from high school and I started a DnD podcast to try and be creative together. The podcast is a 1-on-1, with just one player and one DM, and is intended to be short-form: our episodes tend to only be about a half-hour long. 

The story follows Toby Flutterheart, a 16-year-old wizard looking to become the greatest adventurer in HingleDingle, and all of his failures on the road to reach that goal! 

So far he's fought goblins, gotten in bar fights, been transformed into a slinky, accidentally ruined a perfectly good flash mob, and more!

It's been really fun because the podcast is very different from how we both play D&amp;D, in that we're mostly trying to make each other laugh. Sometimes that means cutting the corners on the rules, and leaning into role play more than anything else. 

I'm posting here because I'm looking for honest feedback! We're pretty new to this still, and we're having fun. By no means do we expect the show to blow up, but we figured it would be awesome to connect to the community and see what people think. Like I said, we cut corners on the rules, because we're mainly looking for entertainment value. That said, I'd love to hear what people like and don't like about the podcast! (as long as its constructive, lol)

DnD,mougatu,1,"Want to get opinion to see if my idea is to far fetch for the ending of my story I have a homebrew game that we‚Äôve been playing for a while. The story is the king died. The prince and princess are trying to gain control of the throne. 

For them to do so they need the votes of the nobles. There are 7 provinces with a noble ruling over it. 

My players are tasked to go noble to noble and complete various quest to secure their vote. 

I‚Äôm looking to wrap it up since we‚Äôve been playing it for a long time. 

Recently one no le wished to be on the war council since Ocrs are trying to invade. 

I had idea of the head war counsellor wife being killed and having to bring the assassin head so that the old man would retire and give his spot to the nobleman. At the funeral the orcs attacked. 

Now is it to much of a stretch to have it most noblement and the prince and princess die (it was a large surprise attack) and make it so the new lead war counsellor orchestrated a lot of things?

It would be out if left field for the players since this nobleman has been pretty good in the game but his province is next to the orc lands and his background is that he‚Äôs just trying to defend the country but  doesn‚Äôt have the resources to do so?

You think it‚Äôs good idea to turn him for surprise? I was thinking he let the Orcs pass and let them attack so he can gain control of the country as long has the prince and princess die.",1
DnD,DrunkleSam47,2,"My players are finally embracing their autonomy in their narrative! This is a minor achievement for me but I wanted to write down a quick ‚Äòproud papa‚Äô moment from a home brew campaign I‚Äôm DMing. Short background: the players were on a boat and had to dock in this really crappy town that one of the players said they were from in their background. He‚Äôs an assassination rogue and I gave him a note with a target, location, and a rough drawing (kobold missing a left ear and burned on that side of the face), no other input. Pc‚Äôs backstory was he was looking to get into the guild‚Äôs good graces after a botched job relegated him to the shitty backwater. 

My first thought was PC was going to go in and straight up murder someone, which I was prepared for. My PC‚Äôs contract holder would then reveal themselves, furthering the story. 

Instead, PC brings the party to an old tavern that he made up and I heard about for the first time on the fly, rolling well on persuasion, slight of hand, and stealth checks throughout to convince the bartender to distract the party (with a helpful 10g bribe, uninvited), long enough for him to reconnoiter his target. 

He gets to a nondescript run down fishing shack built into a hillside by the river, sneaks up to the windows, looks around, checks the other side of the building, climbs into the second floor window.  Inside it‚Äôs lavish (it‚Äôs actually an abandoned metallic dragon‚Äôs lair) and much bigger than expected. He sneaks a bit, sees the target and a few other people, and climbs back out. 

Cut back to the party, and he wraps up the session convincing the party ‚Äòhey, I know we have a mission. But you may have noticed this town is a piece of garbage. And I know why - it‚Äôs this guy. He takes from everyone and gives nothing back. And I know how to fix it. Will you help me?‚Äô

So I went from having a quick throwaway ‚Äòhey you kill this person as a test to meet this other person‚Äô to it becoming an epic do-gooding to take down a crime boss and setting up them saving a players hometown, while distracting the rest of the PCs in a made up tavern he was a local at. 

May seem like a minor difference, but it was really really rewarding having one of my players test the bounds of what they can do outside of combat and see how much of the narrative they actually control.  I‚Äôve been telling the party for months - this world has stories, you get to help me discover what they are. This is the first time I feel like I‚Äôm experiencing that!",1
DnD,PretzelFreakout2017,10,"Statistical Analysis of 5e Enemy Ability Scores Hi All,

I'm brand new to tabletop D&amp;D, so sorry if this is an obvious question. I tried searching for it and didn't come up with anything.

#Summary
Has anyone ever done an analysis of the ability modifiers of common 5e D&amp;D enemies, e.g. to see whether learning an action with a Strength saving throw is going to be more successful long-term than learning an action with a Dex saving throw? Of course it depends on the campaign you're running, but I'm just curious.

#Background
I'm brand new to tabletop D&amp;D, and I have a slight tendency to overthink decisions for my PC. I'm playing as a Wood Elf Monk, and I'm planning on going the Way of Four Elements. I'm trying to decide if I want to take the Fist of Unbroken Air discipline or the Water Whip discipline. They're almost identical (3d10 bludgeoning on failed save, ability to knock prone, push or pull enemy ~20 feet). The main difference between the two is that the former relies on a Strength saving throw, and the latter on a Dex saving throw.

That got me thinking, since I want to take the one that's most likely for enemies to fail the throw. My gut tells me that most creatures that attack with their bodies have a higher Str, and most creatures that use a weapon probably have higher Dex. But I have no clue, and I was wondering if anyone had ever broken that down.

Anyone have any ideas or opinions?",1

My players were my significant other and his friends, and all were were first timers, so we used the pregenerated characters out of the starter set for Lost Mines. A couple thoughts:

* They did surprisingly well with the first goblin encounter, which was the part I was most nervous about
* Things almost immediately took a left turn when they decided to split the party after the goblin ambush. Two of them went to the Cragmaw Hideout and two went to Phandalin to give Barthen his supplies.
* However, the two PC's who went to Phandalin almost immediately decided to see if they could sell their provisions meant for Barthen to another person for a higher price, and did this by loudly proclaiming their intentions in the town square. They are now not on good terms with Barthen.
* All in all, they reunited, have the information they need to find the Cragmaw Hideout, and are eagerly awaiting our next session this week. 

I guess the most important thing is that all my players said they had a blast, which is the best I could have hoped for. All respect to the DM's who have been doing this for a while, I never realized how easily your plans can go off the rails once the PC's get involved.",1

DnD,DudeStranger,9,"Role playing a Flaw Hi,

this is the first time being on reddit so bear with me :D For a few weeks now every Sunday i play dungeon of the mad mage with some friends of mine (thanks corona for the extra spare time :D). At the end of today's session we entered the 6th layer trough a portal. Because my char went in first i was the one who stepped on a rune which gave me madness and a flaw. The madness wasn't that bad, but the flaw he gave me is kinda shitty imo, or at least i have no idea how 2 play it out. He gave me the flaw "" I fundamentally disagree with everything anyone else says "" and ofc i wont tell my mates that i gained that flaw (which my dm told me can only be cured by greater restoration)

First a few details to my character. Valas is a male half drow collage of the whispers bard currently level 8. My char hates the Drow that worship lolth (like a holocaust survivor) and wants to see them all dead by all ""legal"" means. But except for that he is a laid back kinda guy, but also really cautious in tough situations and wouldn't act recklessly. Also Valas likes his party members and trusts them a lot, a team player u could say. Valas uses his skills as a collage of whispers bard to Infiltrate the enemy so when it gets to a fight , he'll be trying to create a situation so in the fight it gets easier for all of his mates (like we have the high ground kinda thing \^\^)

now i know i could get greater restoration at level 9 as a bard

but tbh it wouldn't make any sense if i cured my own flaw (in my mind Valas doesn't realize he has a new flaw to begin with)

also next i'd like to multi class 2 levels in warlock hexblade.

now i am thinking about how to role play my new flaw so my mates get suspicious about the change in attitude without me being a dick or starting useless arguments all the time(which i don't like 2 beginn with), a few tips on how i could handle that situation, without ruining the fun of the game, would be great",1

DnD,shaidyn,17,"What kind of income would you say nobility gains from lands they own/control? Hey, folks! In my upcoming campaign I plan on raising the player characters to the aristocracy and then building the story around politics and jockeying for position. As a part of that process they will become titled and landed nobles, meaning parts of the country will come under their control. A town here, an abbey there, that sort of thing.

I'm curious if y'all have any resources or opinions on how much income a noble might receive from an average hamlet. Looking at the expenses table on page 157 of the player's handbook, it says an aristocratic lifestyle requires 10gp per day minimum, or roughly 300 gp per month. I can't imagine a town producing that much profit per month, meaning a noble would have to control several towns at once in order to really live that upper class lifestyle. Which makes sense to me. But where do I draw the line?

So there's the question: How much income do you think an average farming/trading village can provide to the noble who controls it, per month? Or, phrased otherwise, how many such villages does a noble need to control in order to maintain an aristocratic lifestyle of 10gp per day, 300 gp per month?",1

DnD,Dukememes6047,8,"I had an idea for a one shot fir level one characters, is this balanced? Please give advice! Here‚Äôs the main idea:

The players start as fired hands for a small caravan. They are tasked with taking important cargo through a dangerous area. 

Days 1 and 2 go smoothly. Ask them how their character spends the time. Are they alert and scanning the horizon for danger? Maybe they are trying to catch a nap in the back of a wagon. Maybe they try to steal some supplies. Maybe they tend to the horses. 

On day 3 or 4 they are ambushed by a few goblins. A few melee types, some wielding torches and setting fires, and a couple archers. This gives the new players an idea about battlefield scale and actions in combat. Have a friendly NPC in the caravan help them out by shouting directions if things get bogged down. 

At the end of the battle, they think they will have won but the caravan Master is distraught and shaken. The PCs then have to calm him down with social checks or interactions. Once they do, they will learn that the greatest cargo was not stored in boxes and wagons; is was the prince‚Äôs prized racing horse that ran away during the battle. The PCs are asked if they can find the horse and bring it back. Double their fee if needed. 

That and character creations should be enough for one session. And you have a nice hook for the next session.

Next Session:

As you go into the forest to find the horse, a group of 2 (or 3 based on the amount of players) giant wasps attack the party. After traveling further, you find 3 paths, center, left and right. You hear a loud neigh and whinny from the right path if you roll above a 15 on perception. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Choosing the right (yes, the right) path leads them to a grotto with a lawful evil wood elf druid. It is level 2, and has the horse in captivity. Th horseblooks like it is about to be carved into, with a knife by its side. You have 2 options.  

-Defeating the elf with lethal force prompts him to say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all for my lord...‚Äù and he dies. Taking the horse back to the caravan ends the campaign with 5x the normal pay. 

-Defeating him with non-lethal force makes him fall unconscious, for the party to do with him what they want. Tying him up with up and interrogating him with an intimidation score above 16 prompts him to say that he needs the horse for an incantation to sabotage the horse so that way the prince dies during the race. You take the horse to the capital and get 50 gold for the info and horse. The campaign ends.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Choosing the middle or left path leads to a loop that leads to the other path, with an encounter of crocodiles in it. When you beat the wood elf in the right path, you have the same 2 options as above, but the horse turns into a warhorse skeleton (with buffed stats) halfway through. You have to kill it or leave it behind. If you leave it behind, it kills the elf, but if you kill it, you can still get the information, but with an intimidation score of 10. Taking the info to the capital, the prince looks pissed, but the king sympathizes and awards 25 gold and the campaign ends.",1

On page 150 of the Monster Manual there are pictures of rocks related to the ""main"" giants (Cloud giant boulder, Fire giant boulder, etc.) 

For the longest time, I didn't understand what these rocks were. I assumed that these were the ""cores"" or ""hearts"" of the respective giant. As in, killing a hill giant would reveal a mossy ""Hill giant boulder"" from the corpse. I read through the Giants section a few times, but found no such information.

Today, by pure luck, I skimmed through their stat blocks. They have a ranged attack called *rock.* Then it all made sense. *They are just throwing these different boulders at their enemies.*

After figuratively kicking myself for failing to see such a simple fact, I felt like sharing this with y'all. As I put it in the title, this may be interesting to use in homebrew.

More to the point, my player was asking permission to homebrew in what's called a Focus.

In the game, this allows the main character Alloy to turn it on an item, basically a Bluetooth ear piece.


Here's his idea: 


As a bonus action, you can enable the focus. Your vision turns blue to except for highlighted things of interest from the Focus in orange. While active, it allows one to add their proficiency bonus (or doubles if you have expertise, or triples your bonus action if already expert) *not too sure about this part* to Perception and Investigation bonus scores (regardless of proficiency in these skills)* to detect other machinery, living beings not invisible, points of interest such as traps, levers, components and weak spots on machine construct creatures, and etc. made of metal with a range of 60 ft. While active, attack rolls made against you have advantage, all saving throws made by you have disadvantage, your speed is reduced to half, and you cannot make an attack. The focus is deactivated anytime you take damage or spend a bonus action to deactivate the focus. 


What do you guys think? I'm a terrible judge of balance. Thanks!

DnD,uncalledforgiraffe,0,"I think I may have subconsciously made my hero/vigilante NPC in my campaign Will Smith. So in my campaign, that I have been building for quite some time now, there is a sort of crime lord vigilante known as The Eagle. He leads a crime organization known as the Birds of Prey. He is well intentioned and uses petty crime to hide his attempts at uncovering a sinister plot within the empire. He is seen as a bad guy and is the most wanted man in the country. The Eagle has only been seen in quick glimpses but he is known to have a very unique and ornate mask that resemble the face of an eagle. He is trying desperately to save his country. In a wild attempt to stop said plot he bombed certain locations within a city that pertained to specific buisnesses of the real bad guy. The city and country as whole were shocked and went wild. They weren't sure if it was the Eagle but many believed that to be the case. Along with all the petty crime over the years and the bombing the Eagle was doing an almost disservice to the city he dwelled in.

And I may have subconsciously created him thinking of Will Smith in the movie Hancock.

Growing up I always loved Will Smith. All around great actor, in my opinion. When I was in middle school I saw the movie Hancock in the theaters. I only saw it the once but I remember loving it. I hardly remember any of it and have wanted to rewatch it.

Fast forward to now (12 years later), I just found it on Netflix and rewatched it and I still enjoy the movie. Great concept. But at the end of it I realized what I may, or may not, have done.


((Spoilers ahead I guess))


In this movie Will Smith plays a bum, alcoholic super hero who tries to save the day but ends of causing more damage than it's worth. Ya know, destroying buildings, people's properties, and even roads. He becomes hated by the public and the authorities want him arrested. 

So throughout the first half he is wearing a hat with an eagle on it. One of the other main character's child, who loves Hancock, asks ""Why is there an eagle on your hat? Do you like eagles?"" But the question is never actually answered. 

Later on in the movie when Hancock (Will Smith) is trying to reform his ways and be a better super hero the other main character makes him a suit. A suit with an eagle on the back of it. He starts to do better and people start liking him but he is still just referred to as Hancock.

The movie ends with Will Smith perched on a building with an actual eagle by his side. Both him and the eagle fly off together, finally becoming a true super hero. Becoming... The Eagle?",1

Players will begin the campaign without their character sheets. I will be randomly generating stats and building characters for them.

I will be setting up a session 0 to see if mechanically this is sustainable but if everyone agrees to move forward I would like to run a sourcebook campaign to make my life a little bit easier considering all the other logistical things I will be keeping track of.

So my question is this:

Maybe you‚Äôre like I was, maybe you don‚Äôt really know what the deal is or maybe you‚Äôre a vet! Maybe you‚Äôve been gaming for years and you‚Äôve experience all the thrills and chills of an epic moment of gaming. 

Regardless of where you come from, I hope you find a way to play and share in this amazing world.

If you‚Äôre looking for a good place to start, you‚Äôre here! On the off chance you feel like hearing others play would help; take a second and check out the podcast I‚Äôve been working on with my friends. I‚Äôve been recording with my partner, my brother, my best buddies and I‚Äôm really proud of what we‚Äôve been doing. It‚Äôs fun, sounds great, entertaining and pretty exciting.

Please take a second and give it a try, even if you‚Äôre not sure it‚Äôs your thing.... after all you never know and this is the time to be trying new things!

DnD,valethehowl,4,"Way of Ascension Monk (Reworked) Hello! I've made this homebrew monastic tradition for the 5e Monk class based on the idea that Monks may try to ""ascend"" to divinity through training, and I've reworked thanks to the suggestions of people here on reddit! I'd like to know what you think about it, if you consider it balance or not and if you can share any tip on how to improve it!

**Way of Ascension**

The Way of Ascension teaches its students to cultivate their inner spark of divinity through training and meditation. Some try to get closer to the gods, while others try to ascend to godhood themselves, but still they have to walk the same path. Monks that follow the Way of Ascension are usually rather ascetic even compared to other monks, trying to transcend their bodily needs and dedicating almost exclusively to elevate their spirits and achieving divine enlightenment. Their sheer willpower and faith in themselves allow them to use divine powers in conjunction with their martial arts, making them very dangerous foes.

***Features****:*

3d Level: Divine Spellcasting

6th Level: Holy Resistance (1/rest)

11th Level: Enlightened Will (1/day)

17th Level: Awakened Form (1/day)

***Divine Spellcasting***: *The Monk is able to cast Divine Spells using the faith in himself and his willpower rather than drawing power from a divine being.*

The Way of Ascension Monk is capable of casting some spells from the Cleric spell list, using their own Wisdom as modifier and paying some Ki Points. These spells do not require any material focus, if one is needed, but a Way of Ascension Monk cannot cast more than 6 spells per day with this feature, even if they have enough Ki points to cast them.

Spells Obtained at the 3rd Level (Cost 2 Ki Points): *Bless, Cure Wounds, Detect Evil and Good, Protection from Evil and Good*

Spells Obtained at the 6th Level (Cost 4 Ki Points): *Aid, Calm Emotions, Lesser Restoration, Enhance Ability*

Spells Obtained at the 11th Level (Cost 8 Ki Points): *Beacon of Hope, Mass Healing Word, Revivify*

***Holy Resistance:*** *The Monk calls upon their divine willpower to resist a negative effect.*

Once per long rest, when the Way of Ascension Monk fails a Saving Throw, he can choose to remake it, and the new result is permanent. This can also be used for Death Saving Throws as well. This effect can be used only once per long rest.

**Enlightened Will:** *The Monk uses his own willpower to warp reality, making causality shift in his favour.*

Once per day, the Way of Ascension Monk can add 1d6 to any throw he makes.

***Awakened Form:*** *The Monk partially ascends to his divine form, gaining the power and appearance of a divine being.*

Once per day, the Way of Ascension Monk can assume their Awakened Form for 1 minute. When they do so, they turn into a reflection of their inner divinity, gaining a glowing aura and ethereal features (ghostly wings, a halo, etc). While in this form, the Way of Ascension Monk gains Temporary Health Points equal to half of their health (rounded down), they gain resistance to necrotic damage as well as bludgeon, piercing and slashing damage from non-magical weapons. While in this form, the Way of Ascension Monk also gains a bright aura of any color they want that casts bright light in a 20ft radius and dim light for an additional 20ft. Any magical darkness within 20ft of the character is dispelled, and all enemies within this distance that target the Way of Ascension Monk for an attack suffer from Disadvantage on the Attack Roll.",1

DnD,soldierpallaton,4,"Layout for a necropolis Hello everyone! I asked this subreddit for help with a vampire den dungeon that I made for my players a few months ago and I'm asking for help again. Okay so the next dungeon the party is going to be entering is a labyrinth. They can not enter the city they have to enter due to it being walled off from visitors so they have to enter through the catacombs. 

So the backdoor entrance into the catacombs lies in the bottom of a well and going through they will enter ruins of an ancient, highly advanced city. It's a necropolis due to the dead roaming around it still. It has 78 rooms and is cavernous. I was wondering if you all could help give me ideas for what to include? Like enemies, traps, just cool stuff and treasure to include in this labyrinth.

DnD,wordthompsonian,1,"Running my second one-shot, a political assassination. Help needed for encounters!  As the title says, this will be a one-shot, likely spread out over 5-6 sessions. Here is the world map from our main campaign: [Continent of Northwind](https://inkarnate.com/maps/rWN4xzpB7oklyJaORMYgVLDXkPwLeq0wEXGbj2v6PD1K5ZQ8/MTU5MDAyNzQ4NzQyOQ==)  and the [Island of Ug‚Äôlug‚Äôlug](https://inkarnate.com/maps/1RjoaPYZ3bz5EqdXk26rD96BOrQ904eWJQGxnygvlpBOVwMN/MTU4ODkwNjk1MTI4MA==)  

The setting is this: The gnome kingdom has intel from a sympathetic goblin that the current hobgoblin leader of the goblin island of Ug‚Äôlug‚Äôlug is an even more cruel tyrant than the goblins can handle. Marshwood has assembled their G-TAC (Gnome Tactical Assault Company) and is sending them on a political assassination mission.

The 4 PCs are all gnomes (obviously). They are all starting at level 8 in whatever class they like, PLUS it is assumed that G-TAC has trained them in 4 levels of Assassin Rogue, so we have 4 level 12 PCs. These PCs are going to be ridiculously powerful but that‚Äôs kinda the point. The BBEG I have created is the hobgoblin chief who is a Warlock/Fighter. The team‚Äôs intent is obviously going to be to infiltrate the city ([city map here](https://inkarnate.com/maps/Z8EdnbK4jq5RoaMBwVNYQA5JVp89D603W1PzOJGgekyX27xl/MTU4OTU2ODQxMjQ0NQ==)), gather intelligence while disguising themselves as goblins and trying not to get found out, then assassinate the chief as quietly as possible. 

Do you have any ideas for mini-encounters or perhaps the final encounter to keep it from them steamrolling everything?",1

DnD,NapkinDungeonMaster,2,"GM Inspirations: Crystalline Lair &gt;*""Never underestimate the importance of self-knowledge. It is our anchor to this world and to ourselves. Without it we are completely and utterly lost, paralyzed by indecision, filled with crippling anxiety of the unknown and unable to achieve anything remotely worthwhile. Without knowledge of self we are nothing more than blind, drunken beggars shuffling through the maze of life. Never underestimate its importance.""*

&amp;nbsp;

There is a story retold by the locals about when Opaila, then named the Innocence of Truth, now only known as the Mistress of Truth learned that her human lover had betrayed her through infidelity. The story goes that as she turned away and ran blindly, deeper into the woods, she came to a large lake. She dropped to her knees at the shore, and as her tears fell to the lazy waves, the entire body of water was crystalized.

&amp;nbsp;

When it was discovered that the crystalized glass had the peculiar ability to reflect your true self, some of the crystal was mined and fashioned into mirrors and windows. These crafted items were extremely rare as it was near impossible to remove a piece of crystal large enough without it shattering to a thousand pieces like Opaila‚Äôs heart. The select few pieces that did not shatter quickly became prized possessions.

&amp;nbsp;

At least two such pieces remain today. The first is a mirror used by the ruling family in Arbalast. Upon ascension to the throne, the would-be ruler must gaze into the mirror in the presence of his family, the nobles, and a dozen commoners selected by lot. The mirror would then show the true character and intention of the user to everyone present. This has helped keep their rulers honest and just, and helped them avoid quite a few potential tyrants. It has also greatly assisted the country with diplomatic agreements when it came to rooting out deceit and building trust.

&amp;nbsp;

A second piece, used by the Blades of Ylinos - a very secretive assassins guild, is a large pane of framed, crystallized glass that was originally a window. The Blades of Ylinos ironically also doubles as brokers of truth. For the right price they will abduct a person of interest and place them in a dimly lit room, where the person is asked up to 3 questions while a spymaster stands opposite them, with the framed crystallized glass panel in between them. The person will then be returned to their home, and the employer will be notified of what the abductee answered, and whether they were truthful or not.

&amp;nbsp;

*But back to the crystalline lair‚Ä¶*

A few centuries ago, a minotaur wizard completed the ritual to become a lich and dug an elaborate maze in the crystallized lake. Over the years their presence has corrupted the lake and its surroundings. Many explorers have succumbed to the maze and the psychological horrors it holds. The seemingly endless maze is filled with incessant, taunting whispers, causing anyone who enters to start doubting themselves, and who they truly are. Their reflections in the crystal walls start off as true, but as they venture deeper into the maze, slight distortions and twists to the truth are introduced, barely noticeable at first - until the person is driven mad by no longer knowing who they really are.

The crystalline reflections show different things to different people, twisting and tearing at the truth while the barely audible whispers reinforces the reflected images. Someone who is known to sacrifice for loved ones might start believing that they are doing so out of selfish reasons. A person with natural beauty might be convinced that they are in fact hideous, and being lied to by everyone. A person who knows what it is to be loved by someone can start believing that they are in fact only tolerated by those who love them. Once they believe the first lie, the reflections change, convincing them of the next lie until there is nothing left of who the person was.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

*I hope that you can use this idea in your story or world. Feel free to use it as is or change it up and make it your own. If you feel like some creative writing, I'd love to hear any other ideas you might have for items created with the mined glass. Perhaps a different creature would make a lair in the lake, and what would that look like?*",1

DnD,cheftoop,2,"Sometimes dice tell a perfect story A (long) bit of context before the proper story:

I am playing as a tiefling bard, who was left in front of orphanage in capital of Icewind Dale. The only items he possessed were a medallion with an unknown symbol and a piece of parchment with ""Vyjud Weisl"" written on it. It was assumed that this was his name. With violet skin and golden eyes, he looked like a weird half-elf. He wasn't the most popular child but he had a couple of close friends. Things changed in his early adolescence when his horns started growing and rumors started spreading of his devilish ancestry. Afters a few years of being bullied, he ran from the orphanage and went to Lonelywood - a town full of misfits. He eventually was noticed by Azure, a tiefling leader of the biggest ring of thieves in the town, and taken in by him. When Vyjud introduced himself, Azure only smirked and said nothing.

At first, things went fine, but after some time, everyone in the band started bullying and abusing Vyjud, he was assigned the worst and most degrading jobs. But the process was so slow that it took him a long time to realise that. A few years passed since he had joined the band and his horns finally grew to their full size and that is when he realised that he could understand the words that were taken as his name - Devil's Spawn. He went to confront Azure about it, as he must have known that and he overheard Azure talking with someone from the gang, laughing at Vyjud and devising another way to humiliate him.

And so he ran from the town, ran north from Icewind Dale. During his journey, he met a half-elf bard and was enthralled by him and his tales and he started following him. He would always watch the show from the shadows, his horns hidden under a hood but, at some point, the bard noticed the tiefling and approached him after a show. He didn't care about him being a tiefling and took him under his wings, teaching him.

After some time, the tiefling learned basic magic and used it to get rid of his horns, change his looks and pose as a half-elf. (The DM and I decided that tieflings' horns were a sign of their curse and they would regrow every full moon. Cutting them off would be as painful as cutting off a limb, so my character would need to be sedated by excessive amount of drugs/alcohol). The bard mentor left him for my PC to find his own way and stories and so the campaign begins.

My PC, an aasimar paladin and an elf rogue would meet in Neverwinter and they would be assigned to investigate a murder. It turned out it was committed by a member of a secretive society, Faerie. They found their hideout and sent for guards for help. In the meantime, the paladin was noticed by the bad guys and captured by them. Then a group of paladins came in and found the aasimar (bad guys had already left) and brought him to their prison, alongside with the rogue who wanted to talk to them.

My PC was later approached by the guards' general who explained that the paladins' order was new in town but they had a lot of power and they couldn't get the two out of the prison and my PC would need to break them out. She also requested that the party would go to Leilon, a town north of Neverwitner and find people from Faerie, who were hiding in Leilon and get some information from them - they might not be the bad guys after all.

The escape was successful and the party went to Leilon. Not far from the town, however, they rested and were approached by a family of elves who turned out to be fey. They charmed my bard and stole his gold and his medallion. Angry, he went after them and went into a hag's territory. She wanted to make a deal with him - he would get his medallion back but he would need to bring back a certain farmer and his daughter.

Finally, the party reached Leilon and a couple of days passed where the PCs did some stuff to find the Faerie and help some people.

Before I go to the last session, let me explain mechanics of my PC:  
He would try to hide his stump of his horns (think Hellboy) and his tail by always wearing a long coat with a hood and a bard's hat (instead of hood) and he had shaded glasses to hide his eyes. After every encounter in which there was a chance something might show, I would need to roll dexterity save. I would use Disguise Self and Minor Illusion a lot to hide anything that might stand out. The horns would grow every full moon and it would take them only a few hours to fully grow but if my PC cut them off whenever they started growing, they would stop. My PC would know when the full moon was coming and he could prepare for it.

So, let's get into the session:

The party went to mines to get rid of crawlers (homebrew dog-sized spiders). The fight with the first three went so smoothly, we thought it would be a walk through a park but then we went deeper into mines and were almost TPK'd two encounters later when the crawlers surprised us. Even with Perception rolls of 23, we could not hear them coming. It did not help that we started rolling like shit, while our DM's rolls were almost always extremely high. We came back alive from the mines only because the DM was actively trying not to kill us when we got to the boss. I personally was having the worst rolls, with the highest bonus to Initiative, I would always start last. However, then the DM requested dexterity save from the after the last fight, I rolled a nat 20.

We went back to the town, celebrated and the aasimar and elf went back to our inn for an early night. My bard stayed a few hours longer and went back when it started to get dark. The full moon was approaching.

The PCs had separate rooms, so my bard entered his room, took all required things and sneaked (nat 20) to the cellar. In the meantime, the elf woke up and went to the roof to observer the surrounding (nat 20 Perception roll). The bard closed the cellar door from the inside, summoned two Unseen Servants, had them tie him up and gag him, and snorted a ton of drugs. Then one of them would hold him down, while the other would cut down his horns with a saw and bandage the wounds. DM had me roll for Constitution (DC 15) and I rolled 14 (with modifier). The elf heard some screams from the cellar. She opened the door and saw my PC. I told DM I had prepared for such occasion and wanted to cast Disguise Self and, after much deliberation, he agreed but only if I had a successful DC 20 Constitution check and I rolled a nat 19 (with +1 modifier). The elf saw my character with two wounds on a top of huge scars on forehead. She ran to get the aasimar and he came to help. He stripped my character's torso and they both saw a lot of scars, some very old, some fairly fresh. DM ordered Investigation check against my spell DC. The aasimar got a nat 1 and the elf got a 4. The next morning, they wanted to know what the hell happened and I told them a sappy story about an abusive barbarian father and a drow mother who helped me escape.

Since all the talks about mechanics was done in confidence, other players have no idea what really happened and they now think that my PC is self-mutilating due to daddy issues. I can't wait when my PC will finally trust other characters and tells them the truth and I will be able to tell other players about the strangest luck with the dice rolls that session.",1

Crossbow Expert: Crossbow expert, as we probably know, allows you to make a weapon attack with a hand crossbow as a bonus action, if you attack with a one handed weapon as your action. (Which can be the hand crossbow.) You also ignore the loading quality, and you can attack at point blank.

* Assuming all attacks hit, you will deal 2D6+6 damage per turn. You average at 13.
* You will have 18 AC as a fighter who can wield a shield, that's really hefty, and the tankiest of all three options
* You get to be dexterity, meaning you can use STR as a dump stat. This is good or bad, depending on how you look at it. (I'm a fan!)
* 30ft of range before disadvantage. That's pretty solid.
* You get to benefit from archery, arguably the best fighting style, for a whopping +7 to hit at level one, despite having multi-attack.
* Can't opportunity attack, let's hope enemies want to attack you through that 18 AC and not simply walk over to your squishy caster. But you can punish them with your +7 to hit.

Polearm Master: Again, as we know, you can attack, then make a bonus action attack with your pommel. And also, the reaction weapon attack thing when someone literally just walks up to you.

* Assuming all attacks hit, you will deal 1d10+1d4+6 damage per turn. You average at 14.
* You'll have the lowest AC of the three options, at 16. Which is still decent.
* You have 10ft of melee range, which combined with your reaction, is extraordinary.
* You'll get to attack anyone who walks within 10ft of you. Just because. That's strong. This is the reason why most people believe polearm master to the the strongest option.
* Others provoke attacks of opportunity from you real easily, and you have a strong 1D10+3 melee. Crossbow expert doesn't really do any reactions at all.
* You get to take great weapon fighting style, so rerolling any pesky 1's or 2's is good. Especially when 1/2 is 50% of a D4's potential rolls. Is this better than +2 to hit though? Hmm.
* Your action surge is the strongest of all three classes.

Dual Wielder: Basically, you can dual wield weapons that aren't light, as long as they're one handed. So that's from 1D6 to 1D8 weapons, you get an extra AC, and you're better at object interactions kinda.

* Assuming all attacks hit, you deal 2D8+6 damage per turn. You average the highest of the three, at 15. So you'll be the hardest hitter, and reliably so. Also, aren't D8's the most satisfying dice shape to roll?
* You'll have 17 AC. A good middle ground.
* You have 5ft of melee range. Meh.
* This option probably has the best synergy with champion, some one-shots go to 3. With PAM, if you crit, it might be a critical D4, and that's underwhelming for a crit, and a critical D10 is only a tiny bit better.
* Others can provoke attacks of opportunity on you, unlike with CBE.
* You can be a dex or strength fighter, so that's a versatility point.
* Your fighting style is gonna give you +3 to damage on your offhand. The other two options already have their mods attached to their bonus actions, and get to take a fighting style to give them an extra benefit.

So, that's pretty much the three choices we've got to choose from. Personally I think dual wielder is the weakest of the three, but if you get to level three in your one shot, you might pull ahead. But I still think it loses, even so. So PAM vs CBE, which is better? It depends. If you're the main frontliner, I'd say 100% PAM. If you're one of multiple, then CBE might be better. PAM gets those sweet reactions, and they're massive, but a +7 to hit is phenomenal. Like, truly something to be proud of... what do you guys think, who is the winner?

Weapons are more than just objects that adventurers carry to stab, slice, or break enemies with. In the proper hands of a master, they can be powerful tools to gain the upper hand against an enemy. A weapon perk is a special skill or technique that can be used with a specific weapon. This allows each weapon to feel unique among all of the options the adventurers have, and hopefully give them their own identity.

In this system your character has two sheets. Your Base State and your Transformed State. Your Base State is basically just you in your civvie form and is either restricted to level 1 or is equivalent to your Transformed State's level √∑ 5 rounded down (minimum of 1). You must have at least one level in your Transformed State to be that class in your Base State.


Your Transformed State is tied to a magic item called a Changer you have to be attuned to.
Changers have a variety of names, shapes, sizes, power sets, origins, and likewise nonsense; but all give you a Transformed State. They can act as a Spellcasting Focus and are standard gear for anyone over level 1.
You can Transform into your Transformed State as a Bonus Action. When in your Transformed State your clothes, armor, and weapons undergo significant cosmetic change.
Your Changer is stored in its own personal pocket dimension until summoned and equipped when you use the Transform bonus action, and can be forcibly removed with a DC 20 Strength check or Dispel Magic to deactivate your transformation unless stated otherwise.

- A cleric that worships the god of coin/commerce and expects remuneration from the party for their assistance. (I realise this could quickly build tension in the wrong hands/group).

- A classic old-english monk that takes/repairs shoes from fallen enemies to give to the homeless and poor. Possibly hangs them around their neck by the laces... potential for home-brew shoe-chucks/bola... Will never indulge themselves in wearing something as luxurious as footwear.

DnD,ShiroNoOokami,3,"The Red Ribbon of Dungeon Mastering  

I had an absolute *GEM* of a DM recently, and Tragedy + Time = Comedy. Its been long enough that rather than being mad, I can't stop laughing, so time to share!

Started the campaign stating that he ""wanted us to get really invested in our character concepts"". Everyone has really cool characters, everyone is really excited for the campaign. First two sessions go pretty well.

Then, for our third session. After a natural-20 insight roll to assess a group of enemies from a safe distance, all we get from him is that one of the enemies was ""barking orders"" and ""wearing a ribbon,"" but was otherwise identical to all the mooks we had been demolishing so far. ""Cool,"" we think, ""these morons have a captain, seems like this encounter might be slightly harder than the last two!""

Turns out, our GM had set us up with a deadly encounter with *no* foreshadowing! Ribbon boy proceeds to chop our full-hp paladin in half in one hit. He then goes on to smear the ground with the rest of the party singlehandedly while his mooks throw stones as if they were helping somehow.

Afterwards, we tell the DM basically everything in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYsv_V9UXIE), and he blows it off with ""I don't want my games to be EZ mode no challenge etc"" and ""well the ribbon guy uses the same illustration as the mooks in the DMG so its not my fault you didn't realize he could one shot you, blame the game illustrators"". We were summarily told that ""your ideas about DM-ing are weird and unheard of"" and that ""you guys don't seem to want to play *real* D&amp;D"".

Needless to say, we will never be playing with him again. 

Some of the group reformed to play another campaign with one of the previous players as DM, and I made sure to ask how many ribbons the enemy commander had. [Here was the answer.](https://imgur.com/a/PzBh1M4)",1

The campaign I'm DMing now is nearing level 12, and lacking personal experience of the craziness that may ensue at higher levels, I thought I'd ask here for some advice from DMs that have experience with players at these levels. 

worth noting:
1) I'm not asking for a list of things to forbid, or constrain player choice/actions. I'd like advice to help me prep the sessions. 
2) there's really only one munchkin in the group (sorcerer). While I don't worry about him dominating encounters because he's a real team player, he is definitely a force-multiplier and I assume most craziness will originate from him

DnD,MrClepto,7,"Macho Macho Man: A Mr.Clepto Side Quest Macho Macho Man

By u/MrClepto

*You can start this quest a number of ways. There‚Äôs the Ol‚Äô Reliable Bounty Board on the local tavern wall. You get teleported when you touch a certain object. The local wizard accidentally teleports you. Whatever your little DM heart desires. I went with the bounty board because why not?*

Your Party approaches the Tavern‚Äôs ‚ÄòHelp Wanted‚Äô board for some extra gold to get that catfish your Bard seduced last session a nice wedding gift. One of the papers calls to your Barbarian with more than 16 strength. It‚Äôs a paper that reads ‚ÄúStrong Man Competition. Want to compete? Take a number‚Äù. Please help your Barbarian if s/he can‚Äôt read.

After your Player takes a number, s/he is teleported away from the rest of the party. *Now I know what you‚Äôre going to say. ‚ÄúMr. Clepto, I don‚Äôt want to separate the party.‚Äù Well, I‚Äôm the DM so sit down and be quiet before I smite you with DM lightening.* Anyway, your Player gets teleported to a small faintly lit room with a couch, desk &amp; mirror, chair, some delicious little cookie things, and a pitcher of water. After a few minutes a man knocks on the door and pokes his head in. ‚ÄúMr/s. [Character name here], you‚Äôre going out in five minutes so get changed and get ready.‚Äù There‚Äôs a leopard print man thong/banana hammock/one-piece swimsuit/bikini/DM‚Äôs choice laying in the couch.

Before the Player gets changed, s/he can ask the man questions for a few minutes. They can also try and convince the man to pick a different set of clothing. I always pictured a [Gognak the Barbarian Costume](https://www.google.com/search?q=grognak+the+barbarian&amp;tbm=isch&amp;chips=q:grognak+the+barbarian,g_1:costume:eVPYdwTLAVk%3D&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=2ahUKEwja9-mfx7rpAhUTT1MKHRuACOAQ4lYoAXoECAEQFw&amp;biw=1903&amp;bih=937) from the Fallout series an the other clothing option. If they convince the man, they get the Grognak costume. I would say a roll higher than 13 would suffice. No, they can‚Äôt go out in whatever they came in with. It‚Äôs too Bloody/dirty/tattered/DM‚Äôs choice. Once the questions are answered, it‚Äôs time to get changed. 

*While it doesn‚Äôt offer as much protection as XXX, it does appeal to your Barbarian instincts for some unknown reason. As you pick it up, you feel like the most powerful person in the world. It fits comfortably and isn‚Äôt scratchy unlike most of the clothes back from your home.*

I gave this item a +1 to strength although it has an AC of 1. People will also comment about how strong it makes the Player look if kept and worn.

After a moment, the man comes back and tells the Player it‚Äôs time to get going. When the Player steps through the door, [Macho Macho Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bLRaGo-Qwc) starts to play. The Man escorts the Player through the backstage area passing by other contestants. If your player is wearing the Grognak costume, the other Contestants will look and make positive comments about it and how their man thong doesn‚Äôt look as good/DM‚Äôs choice of comments and leads them to the curtain. Just before going through the curtain, these instructions are relayed. ‚ÄúGo through the curtain and stop on the Xs as you get to them. When you get to an X, stop and strike a pose. After reaching the last X, turn around and come back. When you come back, I‚Äôll lead you back to your room.‚Äù

When your Player walks out of the curtain, it‚Äôs hard to see with the bright lights for a moment. A perception roll reveals a stadium full of people. They‚Äôre cheering and clapping while the music plays. If the Perception check is high enough, the Player can see the rest of the Party in the crowd somewhere.

*That‚Äôs right I didn‚Äôt forget about the party.* After the Barbarian disappears from the Memo Board, coerce the rest of the Players to follow suit. If you have more then one Barbarian, they can also compete if they make the Strength check of 16. If not, they get teleported to the Stadium and have to find seating. If you want to be that DM, you can take them through a grueling DMV like process to get their seats or just have them buy X amount of tickets. *Back to the Barbarian.*

After waving to the Party, the Player will strut their stuff down that catwalk stopping every ten feet to pose. I planned on using a d20 for this to see how good their stuff is. *I had my Barb demonstrate the poses for the rest of the Party IRL.* After strutting 40 feet, they have their last pose. The higher this final roll, the better the crowd responds. The Party can assist with this last roll using ‚ÄòHelp Action +d10‚Äô if they feel like it. After the final pose, the Player walks back behind the curtains. The man can comment about ho great/terrible your Player did on the catwalk and is escorted back to their backstage room.

*As the DM keep track of the four d20 rolls. 1st place is a total of 56 points or higher. That last pose will be worth double points. 2nd place is 44 or higher and 3rd is 20 or higher. 1st place nets 100 Gold, 150 Gold if the player hits 62+ points. 2nd is 80 Gold, and 3rd is 60 Gold. Feel free to skew/change these stats as you please.*

A few minutes later, the man comes back and says he‚Äôs taking you back to the catwalk to announce the winners. The Player stands with the other Contestants and the winners are announced. If the Player is wins, the Gold is awarded along with a bag containing their gear and clothing. The clothing has been restored to their original colors/condition and freshly laundered. Armor has been cleaned and polished. Weapons cleaned, sharpened, and polished too. *Please note club type weapons can nor be polished. They just get the blood washed off.

After collecting their belongings, the bag of Gold is handed out. Right as the Player touches the bag, they get teleported back to their original plane in a field close to the town they were in along with the rest of the Party. Inside the bag of Gold, there‚Äôs a note saying *‚ÄúThanks for playing. Enjoy your winnings, Macho Man.‚Äù*

Hope you and your players enjoy this little side quest.

*-Mr.Clepto*

DnD,SamSantala,0,[OC] [ART] Autumn Bradbury nan,1
DnD,PloopTheWizard,20,"My character met his end during the finale of a 2-year long campaign. I decided to write it. The lich cackled as Jeremiah fell to a knee, weakened. The wights from before had severed something, and the injury was beginning to take its toll on its bearer's body. Leaning on his staff, he stared into the lich's faded retinas. The lich was bloodied, with robes torn and wounds opened, but this wasn't anything above a mild inconvenience to him. His phylactery was safe and sound, behind the magical barrier. 

Jeremiah looked around the atrium for anything to comfort him, but all he found was ruin. Tormir was turned to ash, his remains scattered across the floor. Natalie was lying on the ground, half-frozen to the ebony brick of the tower, her eyes losing their light as the seconds went by. Skipper was lying in the other room, turned into a kenku pincushion by the throne room guards. Only El Grungo and Luna remained standing. Luna nocked an arrow and fired at the lich.

""Roll to hit.""

""Ah, balls. 15?""

""Sorry.""

The arrow whizzed through the air and chinked into the wall behind the lich. ""Is that all?"" he mused. A ray of frost shot from his palm, striking Luna in the clavicle.

""Does a 23 hit?""

""What do you think?""

Luna winced at the impact and staggered backward. She was still standing, but she could only keep up the facade of endurance for so long.

""El Grungo's turn. You're up.""

""Uh, how does the lich look?""

""Pretty bloody.""

""That's good.""

The bruised and battered grung, adorned in a luchador mask and leotard, stared at the lich with malice in his eyes. This was the bastard that was behind everything. This was the man that killed his friends. This was the man that took over his swamp and razed his village. This was the man who forced him to watch as he stabbed his beloved Sonya through the heart. This was Richard Blackspine, the bane of his existence.

El Grungo looks back at Jeremiah. The half-elf was weakened, but he still had a bit of magic left in him. Despite their differences, the two had some fond memories together. El Grungo couldn't help but crack a weak smile as he thought about the Great Bread Heist of Westcott. Their rivalry was one that both adventurers cherished.

El Grungo spoke firmly. ""Jeremiah. You and Luna should worry about the phylactery. I can take Blackspine out.""

Jeremiah was shocked. ""What do you mean, you dolt?! That monster's already killed half of our group! How could you possibly be so sure?""

El Grungo turned back towards Blackspine and calmly replied, ""I've found my perfect jump.""

Before Jeremiah could respond, El Grungo was already charging at Blackspine with outstretched arms.

""Okay, I pop Step of the Wind and double dash at him.""

""Alright.""

""Then, I'd like to activate my action surge, dash again, and grapple him.""

""Make an Athletics check.""

""That'll be a 29.""

""Oh yeah. You've got him.""

El Grungo charged forwards in a blinding display of celerity and wrapped both of his arms around Blackspire, trapping the lich's arms to his side. Blackspine roared to be let free, but El Grungo paid him no heed. His plan was already in motion.

""I'm jumping. Out the window.""

""I beg your pardon?""

""I would like to jump out of the window. With the lich.""

""...alright. What's your jump height?""

""414 feet. I did the math.""

""I'm gonna have to ask you to make an Athletics check for me again.""

""No problem. How's a 32?

""More than enough.""

El Grungo primed his legs and rocketed out the window, cracking the brick floor with the force of the leap. The grand window, made from an ornate pattern of stained glass, shattered upon impact as the grung and the lich soared out of the top floor of the spire. The cool autumn air blasted into El Grungo's face as he soared higher and higher. Blackspine was screaming, demanding to be released, but El Grungo could not be deterred by the cries of a cold-blooded murderer.

""You've reached the height of your jump. Is there anything you want to do?""

""Just one question.‚Äù

‚ÄúShoot.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I in the clouds?""

""...of course you are.""

El Grungo thought back to his childhood, of the days where he was referred to as R'bett. He remembered playing in the swamps with his friends for hours on end. They would chase each other through the overgrowth, climb through the trees, and relax on the canopies, gazing at the clouds slowly drifting by. The young frog always dreamed that the clouds were warm and fluffy, like the wool of a sheep.

Who knew that, after decades of hardships, he couldn't have been more right?

El Grungo started to fall, the lich in his grasp stunned into silence. He looked back at the tower, which appeared as merely a black toothpick in the distance. Surely Jeremiah and Luna were able to destroy the phylactery by now, right? He could only hope, as he gained more and more speed.

""You have about ten seconds before you and Blackspine hit the ground. Is there anything you would like to do?""

El Grungo tightened his grip around Blackspine. He took one last look at the tower, then at Blackspine. El Grungo closed his eyes.

""May we meet again... Sonya.""",1
DnD,DwarfsMatter,1,"Brain wouldn't let me not put this campaign idea somewhere So this is all hypothetical and going to be super broad strokes cause actual PCs bring unending chaos to everything they touch but I am just kind of curious what others think cause it sounds like the kind of idea I would be happy to play through.

So the main enemy of the campaign are going to be vampires and the pcs are going to be members of a vampire hunting organization I would make this all clear before character creation so that hopefully there won't be any major snafu's like someones character being so against the idea they would never go along with it.

Within the first few jobs they do I would have them uncover that the vampires are trying to find/empower an artifact which would allow them to enforce an endless night upon the world. Stopping this would be the primary goal for most of the campaign standard prevent the end of life as we know it stuff.

One of the tasks I would eventually try to have them undertake would be retrieving an object (probably from some ruins of whatever race ends up being my big these guys used to be very powerful then something horrible happened and now they are all gone template) which can inverse magical effects a +1 weapon would inflict penalties on use, a sphere of dark becomes a sphere of light, healing would do damage etc. etc. I would make this have severe penalties which are worse the stronger the effect being inverted thinking permanent stat drain, but have those penalties be heavily mitigated in the ruins (and make it absolutely clear they are being mitigated before they leave) where it was found and design getting out of the whole place and combat encounters in the ruins around using the thing in clever ways.

After they get out and return to the organization make sure they are clearly and heavily rewarded for delivering the object to make sure they actually give it up (hopefully that combined with the penalties of using it anywhere else are enough to make them do so).

Fast forward have them do other things over several other sessions leading them to their confrontation over the big artifact. Make it clear that several of the people they have saved in these other sessions have been recruited into the organization itself in support roles.

Have a big climactic confrontation with the leader of the vampires try my best to sell it as being the actual final boss of the campaign eventually when the PC's win have them take the artifact back to the organizations leadership for it to be ""sealed or destroyed"" before the end of the session have them pick up on this not being what is actually happening.

Next session as they dig deeper they find out that some of the people who were recruited as support staff are being taken away and not coming back. When they follow up on this they find out that they are being forced to use the inversion object until it kills them on the artifact the idea being by the leadership to invert it and use it to enforce and endless day. (make it clear that the leadership does generally think that helping people is the good and right thing to do, but that they value wiping vampires off of this plane of existence a hell of a lot more.) Actual big final confrontation so on and so forth how it ends at that point is how it ends.

So just had to get this out into the world sorry if its a total slog to read but its 6:00 AM I can't sleep and my brain won't let me stop thinking about this until I put it somewhere. On the off chance any of you like any elements from this super sketchy outline feel free to nick them I have never DM'd before and don't see that changing anytime soon.

PS sorry for any grammatical or formatting nightmares in this once again it is 6:00 am and I have not slept",1

DnD,BigPawh,9,"My first time GMing; my party tried their hardest to derail the campaign So I'm running the ""Dragon of Icespire Peak"" premade campaign, and without spoiling anything, one of the quests is to take an npc somewhere.

I thought it would be cool to have the players come across this npc before they knew who they were in the lobby of their inn.

I also read that it's important to give players small fun moments like pub brawls.

These mixed worse than you'd think.

There was a stout dwarf arguing with the quest npc; the dwarf was angry about the current state of things, while the npc was trying to calm down the dwarf and say that things will be alright. One of the players stepped in and it quickly escalated into a brawl.

One of the other players thought they'd help by attacking the (uninvolved) quest npc.

So the player bashes the npc over the head with their lute.

Natural 20.

Maximum damage roll.

Instant death.

Everyone in the inn went silent, then panicked and fled, some grabbing guards as they can. So instead of doing that quest, the players had to hide in and escape from the crime scene, then escape town.

It was still fun though  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",1

DnD,Doomwaffel,5,"3.5e - New spells/feats for a halfling Rogue with magic Hi  everyone,   
I am currently in the process of creating a character for a  campaign and my DM is pretty open to new spells, if they fit the  character and arent OP of course. Feats too, but those are more tricky.  
We use mostly core + Dragonlance books.  


The character ""Mink"" is an afflicted kender (a sort of halfling) that was trained by a wizard and is now a really good thief with a couple of magical tricks.  


Here some ideas:   
Mostly Lv0 or Lv1 spells that would fit the character while still being usefull in some way.  
\- Weasel out: swift. - Cast grease on yourself +10 esc artist  
\- Puff of smoke: Like a smokestick ?  
\- How much?: You immediately know the item with the highest value in sight and its approximate worth.  
\- Summon tools - duh  
\- Mink's unfound pouch: A magical pouch that nobody but you can find.  
Magic hurts:  


Feats:   
The character uses 2Wfighting + W Finesse  
Mink bite: Use your Dex modifier in place of your Strength for weapon damage rolls.  
\- Maybe only 1/2 Dex?

Cunning feint: (req. 2W fighting , Sleight of hand5, bluff 5) - Yea I hate that you need Comb Exp for Impr Feint.  
Make a feint in place of an attack - Too much? It would only work during a full attack anyway and the enemy would only be ff for 1 atk afterwards.",1

DnD,Heliolatrist,6,"I've never DMed, but after lurking both here and on DnDnext, something is rubbing me the wrong way about my DM. So, this isn't one of those posts where I'm asking for help in talking to my DM or on how to engage these issues. This is, simply put, asking whether or not this is bad DMing in general. 

So, I've played in a game for about two years now, and I have a fantastic DM and wonderful players. I've worked my way through a few different characters, had different great roleplay/combat moments, and generally have had a blast since I started playing. 

But, I've recently come to look at my DM and have a more general view of our game. Some of the things I've noticed, in no particular order or with any particular connection, are:

1. My DM removes a lot of intrigue from our game, especially when we talk about our theories on what's going on. For instance, I have a theory on the current dragon baddie, and he just says, ""Well, no."" And explains a lot of stuff that we should never know. It removes not just some, but all of the intrigue in the game and especially roleplay in the group (which is lacking already.)

2. He doesn't give everyone a fair chance. In a recent instance involving me (I promise it isn't targeted, I just remember the one's involving me more than the others), I tried to persuade a person to stand down, even using thaumaturgy to make my voice loud so they could hear me, and despite all of my effort I wasn't even allowed a persuasion check. Two fights later, our paladin tried the same thing and was allowed a persuasion check. This happens very often. 

3. He doesn't roll with the whole ""Yes, and"" thing and it's most commonly on really minor, insignificant things like with our sorcerer's acid splash. She wanted to use it as a 'spit' because of her draconic ancestry but our DM corrected her, saying ""Technically, it'd be cast from your hands."" Which limits our creativity and flavor for our spells a ton. This happened nearly ten times in our most recent session, with large parts of a really intense roleplay scene being outright blocked by him. 

4. ""Don't argue with me, I'm the DM. I have it all written down."" This is, honestly, the most frustrating part. I hear this all too often when players simply ask about turn order or number of attacks. 

5. Favoring players. My DM favors our rogue and paladin immensely, while me and the sorcerer are kinda left in the dirt. All of our backstories are of a good amount, and our sorcerer has a draconic ancestry in a Rise of Tiamat game. It fits really well, but the DM seems to favor our paladin who is magically the son of Asmodeus and our ranger who is the son of an evil lich king, when neither of those things were written into the backstories in the first place. He changed them. Completely. 

Honestly, and truthfully, I am getting more frustrated as I write this. It was mostly just me venting about my frustrations. Maybe I'm overreacting, that's totally plausible. I'm just not sure. I'm hoping my DM sees this and might make an effort to change things.",1

Before I had a level in sorcerer, I got three rings that only elf‚Äôs could use (copied from the LOTR/hobbit) which gave me: 1d6 fire damage to attack rolls with weapons, flying (60 ft), thunder resistance, and I could swim (60 ft). *AGAIN* I knew I was OP but the DM kept giving me random stuff. Later on, I persuaded not one but three powerful wizards to be my friends, one of the wizards gave me 6 amulets that gave me 20 in every ability. I know that that was way too powerful but then why would the DM give it to me? I thought we were going up in a huge fight so that we‚Äôd need them. Later on in the campaign, my pc got into a fight with one of the other pc and the DM literally allowed me to summon a god with my voice because I was a divine soul sorcerer. He allowed me to literally consume his levels and I was a level 12 bard- 1 sorcerer- 1 fighter and 1 warlock. 

At the end of the session we all level up, no matter what level. So i took a level in rouge for that extra 1d6.

One session my DM decided I was too powerful and randomly said 2 hydras came out the sea. We started fighting it and then he changed the stats to a babies(? I think he halved them or something) we manage to kill them whilst in a cave. I casted Tiny Hut (*). I successfully casted it and we got some rest, in the middle of the night we were attacked by intellect devoures, 10 of them. Apparently one from each of the hydras‚Äô heads. Even though we chopped of some of the heads out side the cave. Also my DM said in my 10 foot hemisphere the hydras‚Äô heads were still inside but that means I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to cast Tiny Hut. I failed my intelligence save and got taken over by one. Which just took me into the sea and drowned me, all 193 hitpoints just went and I died. Because of some reason the intellect devourer wanted me dead rather than me as a host. I know I was powerful but I thought he was just gonna make them disintegrate for using them all the time. Is this fair? He went out of his way and I don‚Äôt know if I want to play with that group anymore if he‚Äôs giving me good stuff and then killing me for having them.

Thanks in advance, this is quite a big paragraph so if I‚Äôve got anything wrong I‚Äôll elaborate on the comments.


* Tiny Hut is a 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the Duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects‚Å† within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects‚Å† are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical Effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command‚Å† the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.",1

DnD,Unoriginal134,14,"How to manage trouble with PCs Hi guys, I hope this fits in here and that I can get some internet help from strangers. 

A bit of back story. I am a DM for my group and have been on and off for maybe 6 or 7 years. There is this one player (K) my wife's friend that we play with that always needs to be the center of attention. 

Now in our new campaign, maybe 2-3 months old, we have had a long line of events that have lead up to the major party problems. 

Firstly K played a evil witch character, that's fine, I'm all about character choice. Her back story was that she was into lesbian beastiality and was into animals and animal folk. I told her that people would not be comfortable with this, esspessially as my wife was playing a lapine (Lox). She told my wife that she wanted her character to hook up with her character. My wife said that wasn't what Lox was about. We wernt playing a porn game.

Part way into the first few games Lox was talking to some guards. K/Aminita then decided to try and shove Lox into a bag and take her alone into the forrest. Naturally the guards stood in to defend the law and detained her. After being detained she was released on good faith as the rest of the party was on good terms with the town and it's lord. Directly after this she then decided to light the Lord's house on fire, whilst the guards were watching, in broad daylight. Obviously the guards tried to stop her. The party was willing but hesitant to fight the onslaught of guards to save her life as she fought to kill the guards. They ultimately decided to start fighting, 1 eldrich blast, once she was dead. The guards gave them one more chance to stand down and they did but K/Aminita died. 

K then made her new character Zandar. Over the top stupid was her backstory and this was a character reskin from and old character that she had played before. 

A couple fight of fights later and the pcs face a giant boar. The party pacified the beast, as I was playing it to defend its food and they had worked it out. It was obvious they didnt need to fight but could if they wanted. The Pcs were low on supplies, out of spells and hurting for HP but they refused to rest and kept going only to find the boar. They had finished the encounter, moving on... or so I thought. Zandar then runs at Lox to attack her because ""he's too dumb to realise that a talking rabbit isnt just a rabbit to eat."" (Actually what she said to explain PVP). Even though they had been adventuring for a few days together by now. To be clear PVP is allowed frowned upon in my games, and this was the second time in the campaign, with 2 separate characters that she had PVPed the same character. 

Anyway because of the darkness Zandar ran into the boars territory and it attacked him. Just the same way as it did the rest of the party. The boar crit, and two hit Zandar. The pc's fought to save him but in the end failed and Zandar died.

K then made a third PC Cindar. I allowed her to make an at level hero where I normally let them create one at half a level below. I help her make her new character. Same class, better backstory. Insane stats. 3 20s an 18 and other positive stats. [5e] she says that they are real rolls but the other pc's have doubts but that's besides the point. 

Now I have the party ambushing a wagon that was 'heavily guarded and a very tough fight.' A npc advised them to set traps etc. We ended the game on, roll initiative. 

Now on the next session K/Cindar was sick. That's fine, all good but we have a policy that we play each and every week. It's a known commitment. So we we're playing. 

Now since combat had started I decided to play her character as an npc to essentially deal damage and not make the challenge so difficult. I told the other pc's that since she wasn't here, her character could not die, or have any temp or permanent affects. She is a damage dealer for battle, that's it, just there to help since the encounter was set and started. 

Once she found out mid game she started bitching to my wife about me. She then shamed me to the group in our discord. She told the pc's not me that her character was sick and went back to town, in the middle of combat. 

I apologised and her character was magically not there, for no reason. Urgh I hate that bullshit. She then keeps bitching about me and how I'm always picking on her characters. Since she wasn't there the battle was quite difficult and we lost one of our pc's. To add context I was forced to replay the encounter without K/Cindar. 

I've lost the joy for this. I can't attack her character because she bitches about me. I can't start and encounter because she thinks I'm picking on her. One encounter she bitched about me because a pack of gnolls were attacking the same town that the party was in..... What else are gnolls supposed to do? They roam and pillage, that's what they do. 

Anyway thanks peeps, sorry for long post. I've missed so much but I think I've got the bigger problems. What is your advice?",1

DnD,valethehowl,8,"Way of Ascension Monk  I've thought about introducing a homebrew monk subclass/monastic tradition in my game, the Way of Ascension monk. Basically, it's about a monk training their ""inner divinity"" to achieve ascension and gets closer to divinity. I'd like to hear your opinions about it, what ""roles"" it could play within the game and if it needs to be nerfed/buffed. Here is what I thought about:

**Way of Ascension**

The Way of Ascension teaches its students to cultivate their inner spark of divinity through training and meditation. Some try to get closer to the gods, while others try to ascend to godhood themselves, but still they have to walk the same path. Monks that follow the Way of Ascension are usually rather ascetic even compared to other monks, trying to transcend their bodily needs and dedicating almost exclusively to elevate their spirits and achieving divine enligthtenment. Their sheer willpower and faith in themselves allow them to use divine powers in conjuction with their martial arts, making them very dangerous foes.

***Features:***

3d Level: Divine Spellcasting, Divine Will (Turn Undead) (1/rest)

6th Level: Spiritual Resistance (1/rest), Divine Will (Turn Undead) (2/rest)

11th Level: Divine Will (Custom) (3/rest)

17th Level: Miracolous Act (1/day)

***Divine Spellcasting***: *The Monk is able to cast Divine Spells using the faith in himself and his willpower rather than drawing power from a divine being.*

The Way of Ascension Monk is capable of casting spells like an Eldritch Knight or an Arcane Trickster, only using his Wisdom modifier and using the Cleric list instead of the Wizard.

***Divine Will:*** *Channelling their faith and willpower, the Monk is able to create divine effects.*

At the 3d and 6th level, this just works as a Turn Undead. At 11th level, however, the Monk can choose one Channel Divinity effect from any Cleric subclass and use it like a cleric of that subclass. The Monk can only choose one Channel Divinity type, and can't change it later.

***Spiritual Resistance:*** *The Monk calls upon their divine willpower to resist a negative effect.*

Once per long rest, when the monk fails a Save Throw, they can remake it. It also works with Death Saving Throws.

***Miracolous Act:*** *Using all of their faith and willpower, the Monk is able to perform a miracolous act.*

Once per day, the Monk can use the Miracolous Act to cast any Cleric Spell of level 5th or lower, and they can cast it without any material component normally required.",1

DnD,HoxtonRyuk,5,"[5e homebrew] A warlock and a sorc decide to make a pact with ""The Blind Idiot God"" I dm a campaign of 5 players, two of which (a dragonborn warlock and a highelf sorc) have both decided to be involved with Azathoth, The Blind Idiot God. Azathoth is the warlocks patron, and the sorc has decided that she wants to make a pact with them for power.

Recently, I decided to test these two in combat, the first of many tests for them. They were up against a homebrew creature called a ""Dream Spectre."" (i will dm those who wish for the stats and lore of this creature) they both fell to the creature, becoming unconscious but not in any danger of death (although i am using a slightly modified version of the injury table in the dm's guide). 

Due to their failure, Azathoth has decided to diminish their magical ability. And since he dreamt the universe into existence, he can do so while still oblivious that the universe is real and not just his dream.

All my players said they thoroughly enjoyed this encounter and want more of these kinds of tests spread out through these story arcs and I'm very excited to show them more.

Maybe more updates in the future. We'll see how it all goes.",1

Any tips for feat, items, roleplay quirks I could add?
I dont care about min maxing, more of having a fun quirky character. 
I picked inspiring leader because I plan to role play him as a righteous leader. alignment isn't really a thing in our game but im going to rp him as lawful good. almost like a paladin. 
shield master because I have a shield lol idk if this is even worth it. 

A bit about my character.
uses trident shield and nets.
He is a Grung Fighter Cavalier.
My dm also gives a freebie feat at level 1 for fun so I picked mounted combatant.
He is a knight from some far off water kingdom. His people are very secluded and only recently found out that there are other sentient species so he was sent as an emissary of peace to establish a relationship of peace and trade with the land dwellers. 
I plan to have him not really know customs of normal land people. like shaking hands will be foreign to him etc. Racism, bandits, lying will be unnatural for him as Grungs love each other and forms of war/ self defense are only practiced to protect oneself from dangerous pve mobs. 

im going to be playing him from level 1 so I plan for him to be holding his tadpole from level 1-3 in a sealed bucket/backpack until it matures into a toad that he can ride. for backstory he was given the tadpole as a companion so he wouldnt be alone on his journey. 

toad will be named Trevor",1

What keeps the dragon from casting Blur, Haste?

Darkness on the party and following that up with Grease, then an area of effect like the breath weapon, since each would have disadvantage.

I‚Äôm wondering if you guys have had any experience as or playing with multiple DMs? How did it go? Any advice or ideas for us? Any questions you have for us?

Here‚Äôs a few things I‚Äôve learnt
 - Making NPCs in pairs is really fun and a great way to encourage role play. Having 2 DMs playing in character makes it easier for the players to see how role play works
 - Google Docs is fantastic. We have a folder of folders with heaps of files and information we can both refer to, including a folder for each player which they can access too
 - It takes time. Working solo means you can work it out yourself and wing it if necessary. Working with another person means a lot of talking and discussion to ensure you‚Äôre both on the same page before the session begins. 
 - Communication is essential. If you have an idea in your head and your fellow DM doesn‚Äôt know it, it might as well not exist. 
 - Having two DMs allows for more creative input and awesome collaboration. While I am the primary DM of our pair, my fellow DM has come up with most of the storyline. We‚Äôve been able to weave our ideas together to create a really interesting story which wouldn‚Äôt exist if we were DMing on our own. 
 - Why have two Dungeon Masters when you can have a Dungeon Master and a Dragon Master? I know I love being called the Dragon Master",1

 **---------------** **If I wasn't serious, I would have asked** **---------------** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As passerby's rush past you into the tavern, now a cacophony of yelling and crashing as the brawl begins to swell, you instruct Vurdaar to heft your captive. 

""We need some peace and quiet, and I don't seem to have the breath to yell over the sounds of battle. Follow me.""

With tail dragging through the mud, you stagger to a dark, receded alley across and down the street from the Bloody Fist, Vurdaar walking confidently with the woman slung over his shoulder. As you enter the alley, you see two thugs notice you and approach before Vurdaar rounds the corner, causing the two miscreants to scurry off into the shadowy abyss of the backstreet.

""Put her down, Vur. I've got some questions for her.""

 Vurdaar silently complies, gently laying the woman, now unconscious against the alley wall. 

""Hey Arry, you can use this,""

Vurdaar pulled a small bronze vial from his coinpurse. 

""Captain told me to always carry it in case he needs to wake me up.""

Vurdaar, having first been raised among the harsh mountains of Toril, and spending years of his life on the raucous decks of merchant and privateering vessels, had developed a habit of sleeping like the stones of his homeland. These must be some sort of smelling salt, *a wise move on Captain's part,* you think to yourself. 

""Good idea Vur, how strong is i...""

Just as you ask, you open the vial, and a violent odor immediately assaults your nose, almost knocking you back onto the ground. You immediately shut the vial, looking at Vurdaar who is eyeing you with a puzzling look.

""Are you okay Arry?""

The smell was all too familiar. You though it was the smell of rotting fish and piss when you had smelled it on the ship, not of Vurdaar slowly rising from a restful slumber. You look back at Vurdaar, who doesn't seem to have registered the fetor at all. 

""You look worried Arry, should we go back to the ship?""

""No Vur, it's just... you need *that* to wake up?""

Vurdaar simply shrugs at the notion, then points to your prisoner, whose eyes start to slowly flutter open. You draw a deep breath, take the lid off the vial again and hold it directly under her nose. The woman's eyes slam open as she yells out in disgust.

""UUUAAHHH! What is that, have you taken me to the sewers?!""

You close the vial and hand it back to Vurdaar, who gingerly places it back into his coin purse while wearing a big, dumb smile. You reply to her:

""Good afternoon! I'm glad you could join us, it's Rend isn't it?""

The woman spits at your shoes, eyeing you with a spiteful glare, refusing to respond. Not wanting to wait around in this alley for too much longer, you decide to take the easy route. You grab a fistful of gravel and sand off the ground, and forcefully rub it into the fresh burn you had left on her shoulder earlier. After trying to resist, she muffles a scream, and finally relents: 

""Fine, yes! I'm Rend! Why do you care?!""

""Well, that mutual friend of our, Baxit...""

""Cave rat..."" Rend interjects. You pause, staring at her before proceeding.

""Baxit seems to believe you've stolen from him. Is that true?""

You are again met with the same silence and vindictive stare as before. You shrug, and reach down for more gravel before Rend gives way a second time.

""YES, yes, I did. Whole cart of stuff, a few days ago. But we only stole it because its got drugs the people need, and he's charging an arm and a leg for em!""

""Funny, he told me the same thing. Though I don't know how much people 'round here need Kammarth.""

""It's not Kammarth! It's a cart full of panacea and analgesics! Haven't you noticed the sick goin round here? And why would people need to risk bringing street drugs in on the roads; Waterdeep's a port city!""

This was a new development. You hadn't considered the risk associated with trafficking drugs over land, when you know first hand how easy it is to smuggle anything among several hundred barrels of grain. 

As much as you wanted to go confront Baxit about this, you were in line to receive a lot of money. Clutching the wound in your gut, you imagine running your fingers through the gold you were owed.

""Well I tell you what, I'm owed a *lot* of money for finding you and those wares. So the way I see it, you don't get to keep *this* shipment.""

""But what if it's the last one?!"" Rend cries out in desperation. 

""You said it yourself, 'its got drugs people need,' I'm sure there will be plenty more flowing through them gates in the coming days.""

You stop and think. It wouldn't be right to let Baxit seal away good health behind a golden bars, but you also don't know if Rend is lying. At least she's seemed pretty convincing up until now. 

""So tell me Rend, where have you got ol' Baxits wagon?""

Rend looks right in your eyes and scoffs.

""What makes you think I'll tell you? You can rub away my arm with gravel all you want, I aint gonna sell out my neighborhoods health that easy.""

You smile at Rend, and with a grin reply:

""Oh forget the gravel, I'll just use my little trick and burn your face off and have Vurdaar here cook what's left for dinner tonight.""

Rend stutters for a moment, unsure of how to reply looks to Vurdaar and back to you. Vurdaar, siting there with the same dumb grin on his face, looks at Rend;

""It has been a while since my last hot meal.""

Drawing back the sliver of fear in her eyes, Rend replies through gritted teeth.

""Bullshit."" 

You summon the crackling energy to your hand and in an instant, sling it right into Rend's leg, causing her let out another tearing scream.

""FINE! It's in a small grain store, south end of the docks!""

""Thank you Rend, was that so hard?""

You stand up, still clutching the seeping wound in your gut. You'll have to get that fixed before too long. But for now, there were more important matters at hand.

DnD,EmmaBurger,8,"A very serious question about character designs and role-playing Hi everyone, buckle in if you want and please help me try not to be privileged, appropriate-y, or offensive. I want to make sure I don‚Äôt harm or undermine a single soul with this question or idea..

So I am preparing myself a new character just in case my current character bites the dust. I thought it would be brilliant to design a character after one of my favorite artists of all time (Mississippi John Hurt if you‚Äôre curious). Known as an incredible influence on U.S. blues and folk music, he‚Äôd be a superstar bard! Plus I love playing really old characters in DnD, so spunky and gives some of the adventuring spotlight to an age group that‚Äôs not represented often! However, Mississippi John Hurt is a bl ack man. And I am white. 
Is it okay as a white person to play a black character? I wouldn‚Äôt want to create a character based off of him and just make them white instead because I feel like that solution would be white-washing.. and I‚Äôm not sure if making him a race like a Dragonborn or Teifling would be an alternative either because I wouldn‚Äôt want to erase the ethnicity/identity of someone by making them another race.
If this seems like a privileged, racist, or insensitive idea, I will drop it immediately without hesitation. I just want to make sure for myself and others in the future if it is acceptable, as a white person, to play as someone from a marginalized community.",1

DnD,GorumGamer,1,"Help with High Level Combat Currently I am a player in a long-running Age of Worms 5e Campaign. We've been playing for probably a year and a half and it has been very fun. Starting at first level, we have made our way up to 19th level, and I expect we will face off against Dragotha, the first Dracolich, next session. 

Currently, our party consists of an Ancients Paladin, a Life Cleric, a ShadowSorc/Rogue, a DivineSorc, and myself, a Shepherd Druid. I have not been playing this druid for the whole campaign, my previous character, a samurai fighter, had its soul stolen at 14th or 15th level, and things started happening incredibly quickly that we simply never had the opportunity to retrieve it. 

I am making this post because I do not feel I add much to the party, and want to try and figure out how to do more in our combats. Previously I had been trying to focus on being a summoner, using Conjure Animals and Woodland Spirits, but I quickly found them to be irrelevant at this level of play. By the time I figured out how to bind elementals, (I misunderstood the guide I was reading at the time, and thought it was either impossible or not worth the hassle), we began fighting in areas where it was hard or impossible to have summons (ala the Wormcrawl Fissure). So far I feel the best I can do is play second fiddle to the life cleric and spam Unicorn Totem healing, but even so I can manage not even 1/2 the healing he is able to provide. I'd say I'm on off-tank considering I have the highest HP, along with resilience and warcaster, but because I can't manage to get my AC above 17, anything that gets close will easily turn me into confetti, and have done so- I've died twice since the start of this chapter.

I would really like to be more helpful to the party, especially in a way that stands out without quashing on the other PCs niches. From being a better support caster to a better blaster, the character needs some optimization before we go up against the upcoming CR 30 monster, and eventually Kyuss itself.

2. What about a Beholder?
3. What about the Giants?
4. Could a Hag grant power to a Warlock?
5. Could a Vampire grant power?

So I ask these questions because there really is no defined limit to what can and cant grant a warlock power.

DnD,JDioon,3,"From Murderhobo to Smartypants It is session 7, my 4 player party (rogue couldnt join) is deep into some homebrew shit, under the banner of Dragon of Icespire Peak. Thorlav's module about upgrading existing weapons has caused a blacksmith to enter Phandalin, but [plot hook] he's missing an anvil.
The party ventures deep into the Neverwinter Wood, where, a few encounters later, I have Agar the Hobgoblin Worg Rider Captain waiting for them. Ofcourse he has many friends. 3 Hobgoblins and 20 Goblins (divided over two waves of attack) to be precise. I had it all figured out: the charisma approach, murderhobo, sneakydeaks, any and all approaches I had covered. And for all of those I had written possible outcomes. Then, because thankfully i cant prepare for everything, the party blew my mind. They used the strategic advantage of the entry to the forest clearing (narrow passage) to funnel out all of the goblins and hobgoblins and abided their sweet time and then took mighty good care of Agar (took them 7 rounds to kill him and his mount). They caused all this by something so stupid, yet brilliant, that I could only go with it. They captured a goblin from a previous ambush, ko'ed it, then threw it into the clearing where Agar and his henchmen army were chilling and then had their way. So yeah,they hurled a knocked out goblin into the camp, waited to see what happened and then kept sniping everything that came close. I was mind blown, because before this, all of them were absolute murderhobo's. Now... well, I've grown to love them more",1

DnD,MrClepto,5,"Mr. Clepto Presents: Macho Macho Man Macho Macho Man

By u/MrClepto

*You can start this quest a number of ways. There‚Äôs the Ol‚Äô Reliable Bounty Board on the local tavern wall. You get teleported when you touch a certain object. The local wizard accidentally teleports you. Whatever your little DM heart desires. I went with the bounty board because why not?*

Your Party approaches the Tavern‚Äôs ‚ÄòHelp Wanted‚Äô board for some extra gold to get that catfish your Bard seduced last session a nice wedding gift. One of the papers calls to your Barbarian with more than 16 strength. It‚Äôs a paper that reads ‚ÄúStrong Man Competition. Want to compete? Take a number‚Äù. Please help your Barbarian if s/he can‚Äôt read.

After your Player takes a number, s/he is teleported away from the rest of the party. *Now I know what you‚Äôre going to say. ‚ÄúMr. Clepto, I don‚Äôt want to separate the party.‚Äù Well, I‚Äôm the DM so sit down and be quiet before I smite you with DM lightening.* Anyway, your Player gets teleported to a small faintly lit room with a couch, desk &amp; mirror, chair, some delicious little cookie things, and a pitcher of water. After a few minutes a man knocks on the door and pokes his head in. ‚ÄúMr/s. [Character name here], you‚Äôre going out in five minutes so get changed and get ready.‚Äù There‚Äôs a leopard print man thong/banana hammock/one-piece swimsuit/bikini/DM‚Äôs choice laying in the couch.

Before the Player gets changed, s/he can ask the man questions for a few minutes. They can also try and convince the man to pick a different set of clothing. I always pictured a [Gognak the Barbarian Costume](https://www.google.com/search?q=grognak+the+barbarian&amp;tbm=isch&amp;chips=q:grognak+the+barbarian,g_1:costume:eVPYdwTLAVk%3D&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=2ahUKEwja9-mfx7rpAhUTT1MKHRuACOAQ4lYoAXoECAEQFw&amp;biw=1903&amp;bih=937) from the Fallout series an the other clothing option. If they convince the man, they get the Grognak costume. I would say a roll higher than 13 would suffice. No, they can‚Äôt go out in whatever they came in with. It‚Äôs too Bloody/dirty/tattered/DM‚Äôs choice. Once the questions are answered, it‚Äôs time to get changed. 

*While it doesn‚Äôt offer as much protection as XXX, it does appeal to your Barbarian instincts for some unknown reason. As you pick it up, you feel like the most powerful person in the world. It fits comfortably and isn‚Äôt scratchy unlike most of the clothes back from your home.*

I gave this item a +1 to strength although it has an AC of 1. People will also comment about how strong it makes the Player look if kept and worn.

After a moment, the man comes back and tells the Player it‚Äôs time to get going. When the Player steps through the door, [Macho Macho Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bLRaGo-Qwc) starts to play. The Man escorts the Player through the backstage area passing by other contestants. If your player is wearing the Grognak costume, the other Contestants will look and make positive comments about it and how their man thong doesn‚Äôt look as good/DM‚Äôs choice of comments and leads them to the curtain. Just before going through the curtain, these instructions are relayed. ‚ÄúGo through the curtain and stop on the Xs as you get to them. When you get to an X, stop and strike a pose. After reaching the last X, turn around and come back. When you come back, I‚Äôll lead you back to your room.‚Äù

When your Player walks out of the curtain, it‚Äôs hard to see with the bright lights for a moment. A perception roll reveals a stadium full of people. They‚Äôre cheering and clapping while the music plays. If the Perception check is high enough, the Player can see the rest of the Party in the crowd somewhere.

*That‚Äôs right I didn‚Äôt forget about the party.* After the Barbarian disappears from the Memo Board, coerce the rest of the Players to follow suit. If you have more then one Barbarian, they can also compete if they make the Strength check of 16. If not, they get teleported to the Stadium and have to find seating. If you want to be that DM, you can take them through a grueling DMV like process to get their seats or just have them buy X amount of tickets. *Back to the Barbarian.*

After waving to the Party, the Player will strut their stuff down that catwalk stopping every ten feet to pose. I planned on using a d20 for this to see how good their stuff is. *I had my Barb demonstrate the poses for the rest of the Party IRL.* After strutting 40 feet, they have their last pose. The higher this final roll, the better the crown responds. The Party can assist with this last roll using ‚ÄòHelp Action +d10‚Äô if they feel like it. After the final pose, the Player walks back behind the curtains. The man can comment about ho great/terrible your Player did on the catwalk and is escorted back to their backstage room.

*As the DM keep track of the four d20 rolls. 1st place is a total of 56 points or higher. That last pose will be worth double points. 2nd place is 44 or higher and 3rd is 20 or higher. 1st place nets 100 Gold, 150 Gold if the player hits 62+ points. 2nd is 80 Gold, and 3rd is 60 Gold. Feel free to skew/change these stats as you please.*

A few minutes later, the man comes back and says he‚Äôs going back to the catwalk to announce the winners. The Player stands with the other Contestants and the winners are announced. If the Player is wins, the Gold is awarded along with a bag containing their gear and clothing. The clothing has been restored to their original colors/condition and freshly laundered. Armor has been cleaned and polished. Weapons cleaned, sharpened, and polished too. *Please note club type weapons can nor be polished. They just get the blood washed off.

After collecting their belongings, the bag of Gold is handed out. Right as the Player touches the bag, they get teleported back to their original plane in a field close to the town they were in along with the rest of the Party. Inside the bag of Gold, there‚Äôs a note saying *‚ÄúThanks for playing. Enjoy your winnings, Macho Man.‚Äù*

Hope you and your players enjoy this little side quest.

Now the PC would basically be Pinocchio, trying to figure out how to be a human, how emotions work, and also looking for their creator. I have more details to the backstory, but it's not that important to my question.

My question is, how would age work for such a PC? Would they age like a normal human, or would they be basically immortal?

DnD,maxiom9,1,"Spooky Multiclass Options for a Gloomstalker Starting a Campaign in Eberron and I‚Äôm enjoying my character so far. Playing a ‚ÄúDay Walker‚Äù Gloomstalker, using Shadar Kai stats to play a sort of half-vampire.

My character‚Äôs flaw is ‚ÄúI cannot help but be sinister in everything I say and do.‚Äù We‚Äôre level 5 right now and thinking of going maybe to level 11-13. I know I‚Äôm using my next feat/ASI for sharpshooter, but I‚Äôm not concerned if I get it at level 9 instead of 8.

So then, if I multiclass, what are some of the spookiest options available to get more monstrous and Vampiric? My stats make Dex and Wisdom based classes my most viable choices. UA is allowed case by case.

Some thoughts I currently have are the following.

Fighter: Battlemaster is obviously the best choice here mechanically, but I already do lots lf damage and we have a battlemaster on the team, so I don‚Äôt want to step on his toes.

-Eldritch Knight: I can get a few neat spells out of this, like Fog Cloud, Absorb Elements, and Shield. Minor Illusion can allow some creepy stuff too. My intelligence is 10 though so all spells have to be picked strategically.
-Echo Knight: In this case, flavor the echo as my shadow, a la Dr. Facilier. This is a fun/cool idea but I dunno how well it works on a ranged character. Granted, I could get the dueling fighting style to be more versatile too. I can do some neat teleportation already as well, but this admittedly gives some staying power to that.

Rogue: Assassin is mechanically really good here, but once again, we have an assassin and I‚Äôd like to avoid stepping on their toes. Overall, Rogue as a base is really good though. Sneak attack, cunning action, more skills, and expertise are all great pickups.

-Arcane Trickster: gives some spells and a spooky mage hand ability, making it a bit more on theme than EK. But, my intelligence is still 10, so I have to pick very deliberately.
-Soul Knife: This one looks neat and removes the need for magical weapons a bit, although its mostly just for fun. No major mechanical changes from base rogue. What I mostly like is that the Psychic Blades leave no visible wounds, which is very menacing on a very stealthy pc.

Cleric: This is where magic is actually good on me. Stuff like Thaumaturgy, Inflict Wounds, Toll the Dead have a lot of thematic weight. I have a Wisdom 16 so a lot of options.

Light: This is somewhat counterintuitive on a stealth character, but like Wesley Snipes I am a Vampire Hunter. Gives some AOE and nice defense.
War: Very good mechanically. Extra attacks are always nice and I can use the channel divinity well when I get Sharpshooter. Somewhat Bland I suppose.
Order: Enchantment effects are very thematic! Some alright support options combined with spooky hypnosis. I can also grab Intimidation. 
Tempest: Thunderbolts and Lightning are very very frightening. Fog Cloud is good for stealth and Gust of Wind can kill open flames when I need to Gloomstalk. Thunder spells are very unstealthy, but sometimes thats a reality you have to live with.
Grave: Thematic for undead hunting and decent for healing. Overall this is good but somehow feels a bit lackluster. If the party‚Äôs lack of a real healer becomes apparent though, this might be the top pick.

Monk: This gives more versatility than expected. My AC goes up to 17 with natural armor, and martial arts gives me a solid bonus action attack that is comparable to holding a knife off hand. 40 ft movement is always nice too. Ki points would be only an occasional boon however. Way of Shadows has a great vibe to this, but only at level 6 would I get all the benefits of it.

The BBEG is growing tired of our heroes as he sends a group of Assassins to the heroes. These assassins are known as the Red Storm. They are all Genasi race and varying classes. Once they encounter our heroes they are teleported to an elemental chamber where the Genasi reveal orbs that carrying each of there elements and place them on a pedestal. I roll a d4 at the end of each round and depending on what it lands on, they are transported to the chosen Genasi's elemental plane and the players have disadvantage on attacks against that Genasi and it has advantage along with a few other nasty skills. This goes on for the entire battle until the 4 genasi are killed. Is this a cool and unique boss battle. I tried to make it as cool and interesting as I could.",1

DnD,TheWhexican,2,"Ideas for Sea based encounters for low level party I'm running the Frigid Woe campaign from the Explores guide to Widemount and my PCs are about to embark on a 9 day trip by sea.  Since they just hit level 2, I wanted to throw a couple of fun sea based challenges (combat and some skill/ability checks) so they can test out their new levels.  I'm looking for some feedback on what others think and if these are too hard, too easy, and any recommendations. .

**Navigate a Storm at Sea with skill challenges** 

Pulling an idea from 4e  [https://dungeonsmaster.com/2009/06/skill-challenge-stormy-waters/](https://dungeonsmaster.com/2009/06/skill-challenge-stormy-waters/) and making some tweaks based on this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvOeqDpkBm8&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvOeqDpkBm8&amp;feature=youtu.be) .    The group must get 6 success before 3 failures during a storm.  Upon a skill failure, the ship gets hit and a ship crew member falls over.  1 of the PCs must roll an athletics check to save a crew member (this would also remove a failure from the tally) getting washed out  ship will lose half of is normal crew of 6 people (so only 3 left) and the PCs will take some damage and lose a healing surge each. 

**Repel a giant squid**

A giant squid attacks the ship while traveling over deep water.  The squid has four tentacles holding the ship and the other 4 are attacking.  The team has to do enough damage to the 4 holding tentacles so that the squid releases the ship.  There could be harpoon guns on the boat that the team can use to due high damage but that require a skill check to use effectively.   Each tentacle would have 20 hp and the 4 attacking would do a slam attack at 1d6.  The crew will help and the encounter will be easier if the prior storm challenge was a success with three additional crew members to attack the tentacles and man the harpoons.  Harpoons do 2d12  and take an action to reload.

**Patch the hull**

The ship runs close and collides with a coral reef.  A crack appears in ship's weakened hull due to the earlier storm and squid attack!  The party must help patch it up in the lower level of the ship while fighting off a party of 3 [reef sharks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Reef%20Shark#content) that have made their way in.  The combat takes place in the lower half of the ship where there is waist high water which acts as difficult terrain.  The team must protect and help the renaming crew who are patching the hull.   Patching the hole requires 4 successful skills checks.  The team has 10 rounds before the hull floods and the ship sinks.  If the ship sinks, the team must make it to the escape dingy and row the rest of the way.",1

Hey all, I'm an experienced DM setting up a game of D&amp;D 5e with my friends, and with the pandemic lockdown, I'm looking into options for a virtual online environment to play in. We are already set up with a Discord server to chat in, have all of the books available, and dice to use.

DnD,_Naptune_,0,"Need help with creating little adventures relating to the planes of Eberron I'm DMing for the first time, with a group of new players and I found a campaign idea that seemed like fun. Basically, a rogue group of the Chamber of Argonnessen tricks the players into helping them find artifacts relating to the 13 planes of Eberron. 

There's a few things I'd like. First, I don't just want each trinket to be ""okay go to this dungeon, recover it, rinse and repeat"". I'd like some to involve dungeons, some that must be stolen, some that require diplomacy and roleplay. Anything goes, just need a variety. Secondly, I'd like some of the artifacts to be found in Xen'drik, Khyber, the Mournlands, and the Demon Wastes (the players' characters have little subplots that relate to these places and I figured I'd have a couple trinkets located in each place). Lastly, I'd like to keep things out of Sharn. I like it and all, but would like to run a future campaign entirely in Sharn and it doesn't quite fit the scope of my game. 

So, with that, does anyone have some interesting ideas for trinkets and how the party might recover them? I need one for each of the 13 planes (Daanvi, Dal Quor, Dolurrh, Fernia, Irian, Kythri, Lamania, Mabar, Risia, Shavarath, Syrania, Thelanis, and Xoriat)

DnD,WaserWifle,4,"Mordenkainen's Fiend Folio Vol 1: What you get, and some of my miscellaneous thoughts. I've been eyeing up Mordenkainen's Fiend Folio Vol 1 on D&amp;D Beyond for a while now, but wasn't sure whether to splash out. Until recently when I realised that I haven't had to fill up my car in nearly two months, and figured that meant I could afford to put some of that petrol money to good use. 

One of the main reason I hesitated to buy it is because I had no idea what I would be getting out of it. The premise behind this release is that it's all about bringing old monsters to 5th edition, but 5e is all I've ever known. And even without that, with such a small release compared to previous monster-oriented publications such as the OG Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, I had my doubts.

Well, now that I've got it, I might as well explain what you get with this purchase, for the benefit of relative newcomers to the game like myself. And because I lack self-restraint I'm going to be saying a few things about each of the monsters. There're 18 total, and each one gets a bit of a description. Unlike the other monster manual add-ons, there's no chapters here on lore, roleplay, etc. I knew that when I bought it, but its worth making clear that the monsters don't get much in the way of ancillary info. MFFV1 is all about monsters, nothing more, nothing less. So with that, lets talk about them.

***

**Assassin Bug, CR 3**

We are starting off with a delightfully horrible creature, a man-sized giant fly that lays its eggs in unwitting victims. The mechanics of the egg-laying ability is almost identical to the attack of the Swarm of Rot Grubs from Volo's Guide (which means that re-skinning some Rot Grubs to be Assassin Bug Grubs is easy), and a fairly standard paralyzing bite attack. Its not tough, but those attacks could be very powerful indeed. The lore section mentions whole towns being overrun, and also certain creatures that resist or cultivate these things (including Hags that I love, and expands on the body-horror vibe that Mordenkainen's Tome gives to trolls). This is not a mastermind nor a complex villain (even though it does understand druidic), but I do appreciate just how vile this thing is, it could be a great way to scare and disgust your players and could work as a random encounter while travelling, or as a living bioweapon in a BBEG's lair. This is one I'm sure to use myself.

***

**Blindheim, CR 2**

Wizards of the Coast just love their frog monsters, don't they? These humanoid frogs have the distinctive feature of constantly emitting blindingly painful light from its eyes, mechanically similar to how a Beholder positions or deactivates its antimagic cone. This is a nice little feature, and I do appreciate the detail that it's a bit more effective against creatures with Sunlight Sensitivity, a rare feature in players but not so much in the Blindheim's underdark neighbours. What's not clear though is how this feature interacts with its main attack, which also uses its radiant eyes. RAW, it seems the Blindheim can fire its Radiant Blast in any direction while its eyes are still projecting light in a different direction. Yeah, not sure about that, I'll leave it up to you to figure that one out. 

What I like most about this creature though is the notes pertaining to roleplaying these things. They have an odd fixation on the sun, and its schemes against them, and react violently to anyone who suggests that the sun isn't really doing much. I can just easily visualise one of these guys as a mad wandering trader of the underdark who insists on interrogating any customers about the sun while doing business. Its sure to be a funny and unpredictable encounter for your players, I just wish there was some more clarity on the mechanics. 

***

**Crab Folk, CR 3**

They're fine, I guess. Okay, so forgive me if I have a hard time getting enthusiastic about these. Crab Folk are a breed of giant, created by a hag splicing together ogres and crabs. They look exactly how you think that would look. Burly two-legged crabs. Have all the powers of a crab and an ogre aka they're big and hit stuff and their claw attack grapples and they can breathe underwater, like some kind of knock-off aquaman. And to be clear, I LIKE ogres. They're exceedingly simple, the most basic of basic monsters, but I still like them. But Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes shows that you can actually do some pretty cool stuff with the born minion brute type monster if you just lean into what makes them their own thing. So following that up with a basic ogre with a higher AC and a grapple attack feels a bit underwhelming. The aforementioned tome of foes contains some of my favourite giant-type monsters, and I've been stewing on some thoughts about the giant type for a while now, so maybe the Crab Folk doesn't excite me much because it compounds some existing feelings about giants in general at the forefront of my mind. I have very little opinions either way about these creatures, and not much to say about it either. It is at least a perfectly functional aquatic brute if that's all you need. 

On a last note, the description of these creatures makes it clear that they were created by a GREEN hag. Fine, I like hags and their minions a lot, but did Sea Hags not exist in the edition that introduced the Crab Folk? To me, these seem like ideal Sea Hag minions. 

***

**Dire Corby, CR 1/2**

One of the things that really makes a monster stand out to me more than anything is powerful imagery. And that is something that really works with the Dire Corby for me. The stat block alone didn't excite me much (even though it has a passive AOE ability that I'll get to in a moment), its a medium humanoid with little intelligence and a claw attack, but the description was a blast to read, as short as it was. These things rampage through the underdark in swarms of hundreds strong, obliterating any vegetable or meat they can find. I can easily see myself describing the aftermath of a Dire Corby migration to my players as they begin to worry about what beast caused this, or worse still, the sounds of the approaching tide and their terrible songs. 

Their song is actually their main mechanical gimmick, and I'm in two minds about it. I like passive area effects, they're a neat way to get players to move around the battle map you spent hours on, but there's a couple things in the wording that I'm not sure about. The Dire Cacophony trait stops things from casting spells other than cantrips, but presumably not from concentrating on them. Fine, throw the players a bone, if it stops them from dashing or climbing then at least let them hold their ground a bit, but when the trait says ""the creature is unable to climb"" when affected by this trait, what does that mean exactly? Do they have a 0ft climbing speed? If they're already climbing when the swarm hits, do they stay in place unable to move or are they forced to drop to the ground? The Dire Corby is another creature I'd just love to use, but a bit more clarity on the wording would be appreciated. 

***

**Eye of Fear and Flame, CR 9**

This undead seems to me like its supposed to be an unique boss monster or recurring character rather than a simple encounter. Its main deal is that it wants to corrupt people, approaching them in times of uncertainty with tasks to be done, lies and trickery to get them to perform evil acts. All of its scores, especially its mental scores, are pretty good to excellent. This thing is wickedly smart and deceptive. At least, in theory. I've already mentioned my love of hags, and this thing seems to perform a similar function in some respects, but the hag has innate abilities that allow it to employ subtlety. 

If you want to corrupt someone (probably your players) then you need to exert a gentle touch. And the Eye of Fear and Flame just doesn't seem to have that. It has no skill proficiencies. So its not great at deceiving or judging people (although it does have at-will detect thoughts). It has no means of disguising itself. It always looks like either a black void under a hood, or a skeleton with gemstone eyes. Not exactly trustworthy. And its flavour text seems to indicate that its main mode of operation is to simply give orders and threaten people with destruction. If I was pondering a difficult moral choice, and a strange hooded figure appears and commands me to take one choice over another or be destroyed, that would only *affirm* my certainty in the other direction. I'd say that a DM wanting to use this creature would have to get creative. Just because its not in the stat block doesn't mean its not an option, but when compared to other kinds of corrupting creatures this one seems to fall short when it comes to inspiration in its stat block. 

And in case you're wondering, the name comes from the fact that one of its eyes induces the Frightened condition, and the other shoots fire. 

***

**Forlarren, CR 3**

In essence these fey creatures are cursed Satyrs, an embody aspects of both Devils and Fey. Their alignment is listed as Chaotic neutral, but that's not quite right. They actually flip-flop between chaotic good and lawful evil, between fey and fiend, and this amalgamation is the central concept of the Forlarren, and the tragedy that defines them. Torn between two conflicting natures, they can be either helpful and generous to the point of self-destruction, or scheming villains bent on corruption. When one aspect fails or reaches its lowest point, the other aspect emerges and rules their decision making for a while until it too sees defeat. They have some numbers and actions and innate spellcasting and stuff, but if you want to run a Forlarren, then it's probably because of its unique character. Either a tragic villain or a flawed ally, if you like running games with deep and complex npcs, and your players do too, then this is a good choice. There's a couple of unique story possibilities with this creature. Its one of the few friendly creatures you could meet if you were running an adventure set in the lower planes. Or maybe you could have a quest based around finding a way to cure the Forlarren only for its diabolical side to emerge at the last minute. It's also a good way of facilitating interaction with other, normal satyrs. Monsters that give a good way for players to interact with other kinds of monsters is always a bonus in my books.

Its got some magic and attacks for fighting with, something that's always a possibility even if the Forlarren is an NPC first and a combat encounter second, but as an ally to the player it has a couple of tricks like Aid and Heal to make sure that your players know that he's good to keep around. Enforcing narrative bonds through mechanics is always a good idea. 

***

**Fog Giant, CR 11**

Now THIS is a giant I can get excited about. The Fog Giant is basically a Cloud Giant that has fallen to the bottom of the Ordning, the giant hierarchy. Its the lowliest of the Cloud Giants, and wants its status back at any cost. Presumably the symbolism here is that fog hangs low to the ground while clouds fly high in the sky. Fog Giants, despite their lowly status, are still in essence Cloud Giants, with a taste for the finer things in life and very discerning standards. These guys are bandit kings and secretive leaders of thieves guilds. They like minions with style too, shirking the servitude of barbarian types like orcs and goblins. They're less subtle than most cloud giants, with less innate spellcasting abilities, but they double down on the brutishness, and their Fog Cloud especially gets a buff. Not only do they ignore its effects on their turn, but they can cast it as a bonus action! I don't mind the Fog  Giant being a bit more of a brute than the normal cloud giant, because Volo's Guide already gave us the sneaky roguish spellcaster Cloud Giant Smiling One, so going in the opposite direction here pleases me. In fact, the two variants could even be complimentary to each other with some interesting story potential. Honestly, I've never seen a monster that gets me this excited to run a bandit-themed campaign, and the Fog Giant is a great way to start building a bandit themed adventure for higher level players, especially since the special treasures of a giant make for better rewards, and the unique and elevated style of the Fog Giant means that your high-level heroes aren't demeaned by having to scuffle in the dirt like the low-level rabble. 

***

**Jermlaine, CR 1/8**

Easily the smallest humanoid in the game thus far, the tiny Jermlaine lives in the underdark in secret burrows. They can talk to rats, and get extra damage from attacking in large numbers. They have magic resistance, but with only 3 hit points its not going to help their survivability much. If I was running these creatures, I'd give them one hitpoint. They need to be used in numbers to be a threat, and tracking hitpoints for a dozen or so of these things would be a pain. Another unusual feature they have is their Lurkers in the Shadows trait, which means that they're invisible to darkvision. I would take this to be much like the Ranger Gloom Stalker's abilities, in that if a creature relies on darkvision to be able to see them, they can't. This alone makes the Jermlaine surprisingly dangerous, and an easy way to punish over-confident players scouting ahead in the dark. They have a bit of a comical bent to them too, being tiny evil people with mouse friends that attack mainly because they're insecure about their height. 

***

**Khargra, CR 1/8**

Is it me, or does the Plane of Earth get much more creatures than the other planes? They get their own brand of genie, elemental, and myrmidon like the other three, and also get gargoyles, galeb dur, xorn, flail snails, and now Khargra. I like all of those, I'm not saying they shouldn't exist, but if that's the cool stuff we get for that one plane, I'd love to see what we get from the rest. 

Back on topic, the Kharga is a tiny elemental that eats metal. This takes the form of a feature similar to that of the Rust Monster with the addition of being able to attach themselves to the armour, and they can even bite as a reaction. Considering their CR, they're likely to be encountered in numbers, so in all likelyhood your player's armour and weapons are going to be disintegrated fast. Also note that unlike the Rust Monster, the Khargra does NOT have a stipulation that means it doesn't affect magic items. So be careful to not make your players resent you. The last important trait they have is a limited ability to fly through earth or stone without disturbing it. 

Its lore flavour text notes that some underground folk use them as couriers, getting them to swallow messages and cough them up later. This is a fun bit of world building you can use to flesh out your dwarven stronghold or Dao palace, but is even funnier as an odd way to spring a surprise message on your players.

**Killmoulis, CR 0**

This is one of those rare creatures that aren't meant to be fought, but to facilitate a very specific kind of encounter. The Killmoulis is a tiny fey that will raid your party's food nightly as they travel, and leave a blessing in its place. But if the players react violently to it, it will curse them instead. Its Slam attack of 1 bludgeoning damage seems token at best, because there's very little it could possibly do in combat. No, those hitpoints and AC are just there for tradition, its truly important features are its curse and blessing. If it can get away with stealing a day's worth of rations (presumably for one person, its a tiny creature) then it pays for the food with 10 temporary hitpoints for the whole party! But if you try and hurt it or chase it off, then it will curse you all to not regain hit die on your next long rest. No Short Rest healing for a whole day, nasty. Personally, if your players go as far as to intentionally lay out food or treats (such as sweet things or Goodberries) for it, I would rule that it rewards them a bit more.

The Killmoulis is a nice little pre-packaged recurring nightly encounter, and that's fine, but there's one other aspect to its lore that I want to mention because it's going to come up with two other monsters too. Volo's Guide to Monsters introduced two fey (the Meenlock and Redcap) that are borne of specific intense emotions or thoughts in the feywild. I plainly adore this concept, it makes for such an interesting plane of existence that's highly reactive to the players, and I'm thrilled to see that this idea gets expanded on in this little folio with three more fey of this kind, the Killmoulis being one of them. The Killmoulis is born of charity, all well and good, but is only described as ""emerging from the shadows"". I mentioned above that I like some strong imagery with my monsters, and compared to the other two fey like this that we're going to see, the Killmoulis doesn't quite measure up. Still an overall nice addition though, easy to slot into any campaign you might be running.

**Mite, CR 1/4**

Have you ever just wanted to beat some sense into someone? Rage quit while playing a video game? Talking to an idiot online who is just too plain dumb to realise they're wrong? That's the emotion that gives birth to the Mite. The Mite is infighting incarnate, and another addition to the kind of fey I was just talking about. And since I was just talking about it, then I might as well say that there's a bit more spectacle to the creation of a Mite. An exceptionally frustrated creature will sleepwalk, dig a hole, scream into the hole, then fill it back in. Probably not what your players expected to see while on watch at night. Then a pack of mites emerge from the hole on the next new moon. That's sure to be a weird thing to spring on your players if they decide to investigate the site of their comrade's sleepwalking the previous night. 

True to form, the Mite is intentionally annoying and frustrating. Their main unique feature is the ability to impose a penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. This can be negated though, by using your reaction to... slap your allies. Goodness me. This is an interesting creature for sure, but its other unique ability is to get your players to reach over the table and slap each other in real life to. Be careful when using this creature, it could quickly lead to situations that are not fun. I think we've all been a Mite at some point in our lives, its relatable but not something that fosters good fun.

**Needle Spawn, CR 1/2, and Needle Lord, CR 3**

Lord is a bit of a lofty title for a CR 3 creature, isn't it? I suppose most nobles are only CR 1/8 though. The Needle Spawn is a continuation (or, given the premise of MFFV1, perhaps the progenitor) of the trend of mixing bodies with plants in D&amp;D, as exemplified by Corpse Flowers, Myconids, Yellow Musk Creepers, and less so by Vegempygmies and Gas Spores. Needle Spawn are corpses animated by Needle Lords using plant pods, and both kinds of Needle Dude are covered with their namesake needles. The Lord is not an animated corpse, he's just a load of plants. 

One thing I find interesting about both Needle Dudes is that their ranged needle attack can target multiple creatures at once. Which means that the difficulty of a Needle Spawn encounter is *heavily* compounded by how many there are, since they can all attack the entire party on their turns. The Needle Spawn even gets a feature that means it doesn't receive a penalty for shooting in close quarters. But wait, the Needle Lord doesn't? I suppose he doesn't need it, he's got a good melee attack anyway, but it seems odd that the weaker version has a trait on top of the stronger one. 

From a narrative perspective, the Needle Lord has its origins in the feywild and wants to conquer forests, so its a good fit for stories that include fey or druids and other such forest protectors. I can also see this creature having other evil fey and plant creatures as minions or allies. If you have a ranger with plants as a favoured enemy, then do them a solid and use this monster. 

***

**Norker, CR 1/2, and Norker War Leader, CR 3**

Another one to add to the ranks of low-level goblinoids. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've already made it clear that there are certain simple creatures that I do quite like. And I think I can add the Norker to that list, which honestly surprises me. I think its because they have a lot of character, like most other goblinoids. The Norker is lazy and rebellious while also being exceptionally vicious, you can think of them as a cross between a goblin and a bugbear in that regard. The War Leader's unique feature, called Fight On You Slugs, is named in quite a humorous way, and tells you all you need to know about Norkers even without the lore description, much like how a Goblin Boss' Redirect Attack feature tells you everything about how goblins works. ""Character"" needn't equate to ""comedy"", even though it often ends up that way, and I'll admit that there's probably a bit of comic potential to be mined from a creature that even goblins think of as lowly and pathetic. Depsite what I said earlier, there's one key trait of Goblins and Bugbears that the Norker doesn't share, and that's stealth. The Norker is more like a barbarian, running in without armour, attacking with club and teeth. And the War Leader, despite being a small creature, seems perfectly able to use a Greataxe properly, so props for that. 

***

**Screaming Devilkin, CR 1**

The Screaming Devilkin is surprisingly not kin to devils. Its actually a fey that somewhat resembles a pudgy imp in many ways. The other half of its name s perfectly accurate though: it is constantly screaming. This scream takes the form of an always-on aoe ability that can incapacitate creatures. It has an Agile Flier trait that gives it a lite version of Flyby, but curiously this seems to be a monster that is utterly ineffective when forced to the ground. Not only does it have no walking speed, but its Stunted Legs trait gives it disadvantage on attacks while on the ground. 

But that's all mechanics. What I really want to talk about is the lore. Its the third of fey creatures born of intense emotion, in this case screaming panic. And the mode of its birth is spectacular. Imagine, if you would, describing to your players a scene of them following a sound through the feywild. A distant scream, seemingly one of their own. Constantly echoing through the quite night-time woodland, until they come to its apparent point of origin. A narrow ravine, the air within rippling with the intensity of the rising scream echoing between them. Louder and louder it becomes, until the rocks either side start to tremble. Eventually, the scream explodes outwards with force enough to momentarily deafen your heroes, and the very rocks themselves explode, releasing a swarm of screaming monsters into the night sky. Roll Initiative! I've said it before, strong imagery is something I appreciate in a monster, and the Screaming Devilkin combines it with a planar mechanism that I also really like. This is another one of those creatures I'm itching to try out. 

***

**Ygrol, Lord of Entropy, CR 23**

Well I wasn't expecting that. To those who aren't in the know, like myself, it seems that Ygrol is the first of the Slaad. His is the longest stat block by far, with plenty of passive features, innate spellcasting, legendary actions abound. I'm going to say right now, that I can't make a proper assessment on this one. Firstly, because I've never run an encounter with a creature this powerful. Secondly, because Ygrol is better equated to one of the Demon Lords or Archdevils from Mordenkainen's Tome than to anything else. Unlike most creatures which are presented as examples of their species, these legendary endgame bosses are unique characters, and any attempt to judge them should be made more based on that than anything else. These are campaign-long villains, and so their potential is based on how good a villain they make more so than their stats. That's just there for the end boss fight. Their character is there for the whole campaign. So what does the MFFV1 say about Ygrol? Not much. He gets less flavour text than the Norker. 

There's a good reason why Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes dedicates a whole chapter and then a two-page spread to each demon lord. The length of the stat block isn't impressive, we want to know about their goals, their motivations, their allies, their domain.Ygrol doesn't even get a picture. (And to be clear, all the other monsters do.) I do like that there's a seriously powerful Aberration in the game now, and I'm sure that DMs looking for a mega end boss for their slaad stories will be happy, but to me this seems like a terribly lackluster way to introduce such a powerful planar ruler to 5e players. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that Ygrol was probably the main baddie of some old-school published adventure, where all the stuff I'm whining is missing was present in full force. If you're an old-school D&amp;D Ygrol fan, let me know. This is one I want to like. 

***

**Xill, CR 3**

So I had to break open my Dungeon Master's Guide to check this. I couldn't for the life of me think of a single creature native to the Ethereal Plane, except for the kinds of creatures that temporarily visit such as Phase Spiders and Night Hags. So I went to my DMG to check, and sure enough there's no mention of anything resembling actual locations in the Deep Ethereal. There might be hints, such as the fact that teleportation circles can exist there which implies solid surfaces, and ethereal cyclones carry debris for miles which indicates objects. But MFFV1 straight-up says that there's a load of demiplanes in there which includes dungeons and creatures and places where adventures can happen, rather than just this being a place that only exists during transit, or when you're wondering how the hell you're going to hit a wizard using Blink. 

Well I didn't expect to learn about important parts of the multiverse from this publication, but I know I can use this in my next session. Which brings me to the Xill. They're surprisingly not the main focus of their own flavour text, that goes to the realm they originate from and their potential origins. So information is scant. But they're vaguely xenomorph-looking insectoid creatures with a couple of key traits. Firstly, they share the Ethereal Jaunt feature with the Phase Spider, which also about sums up their combat strategy. Secondly, their four-hit multiattack isn't necessarily lethal. It can deal poison damage to one creature a turn, and if the poison takes you down then you become stable but paralyzed. Yup, the Xill doesn't want you dead, it wants to kidnap you. And take you back to its demiplane home. Obviously this would be terrifying to witness, and I cannot wait to try and spring this on my players. The flavour text names Keraptis as their master, but I don't know who that is so I'll do what I like with them. If you're wanting to kidnap more than one person, then you'll need multiple Xills, so this seems to me like a creature you'd throw in numbers against a higher level party rather than just one against a low level party.

**Final thoughts**

I don't want this essay to be seen as a review, because I'll admit that I'm not really experienced enough to give a thorough review of stuff like this, but I do hope it's helpful to fellow 5e players like me who want a bit more information before making a purchase, and don't know what they're getting from older edition monsters. I personally find that there's only in the realm of three or four 5e monsters that I truly dislike, so I wasn't expecting to be appalled by any of it. Even the ones I was a bit negative towards are probably still ones I could see myself using. 

The fey I was maybe a bit biased in favour of because they mostly filled a specific niche that I wanted filled. I like the emotion-spawning thing of the feywild a lot and its even been the focus of some of my own homebrew efforts. 

There's a good few underdark creatures here, so if you want to flesh out a corner of that ecosystem then I think you'll be happy with what this purchase provides. 

Ygrol is a weird inclusion. There's almost no thematic consistency to any of these creatures, but even then he stands out. Not that I'm disparaging WotC for releasing more unique boss monsters, but he might have been a better fit to a larger release that lets the devs fit in some more resources and information to help people run campaigns that include him. 

There's a nice mix here between fodder-level creatures and boss type stuff. I could see myself running an encounter with the Assassin Bugs, a dungeon with the Norkers, and a small campaign with the Fog Giant. Its a nice variety which I appreciate. 

What do you think? Are you existing fans of any of these creatures? What do you think of their translation to 5e? Do you think there's any particular shortcomings to Vol 1? Have you used any of these yourself? Or do you think I wasted my money?",1

DnD,TheShiv0724,0,"Dear Newbie Me... Just a little thought experiment I've pondered but also maybe something for players and/or DMs to think about everything they've learned since they started playing D&amp;D or tabletop games in general. So that other newbies to look over and learn from our mistakes. Let me begin...

Dear Newbie Me,

You're making a 3 page epic backstory for a Human Warlord . You have created a story about a young general fallen from grace, looking to return and begin his own kingdom, with his own army and how you'll get there... from **level 1**. I have some news for you, Newbie Me, you're going to get your butt handed to you by kobolds. Yes, **just kobolds**. They will end his rise to power in the first dungeon you'll face. This will happen more times then you can think, in fact. You will have your dapper dandy wizard have his head turned to **pudding** by a bugbear, because you didn't invest in any pluses to your Con mod and end up being hit to minus your max HP. You will join a challenge encounter at a convention where you'll be down and dead before your first turn begins (and your *mount* will be the MVP of the game!)

The reality of the matter, Newbie Me, is that you don't decide your character's story, that path forward is for writers only. When you sit down at the table and roll the dice, the outcome of your character's competency is no longer in your hands. (And you should have realized that when your first roll of the d20 landed on a **one.**) If you go into any game thinking every encounter you'll be cleaving skulls, dodging gracefully and essentially always rolling above a 15, you will be so, **so** disappointed by the outcome, every time.

You should (and you will) learn to embrace characters with purposeful flaws, characters who might seem comically out of their depth or not ready for the dangers that lie ahead. But because of that, every failure now feels like it would be par for the course in their life... but also, every victory will feel ever sweeter. So that when your bumbling, dumb guardsmen who first turned from being a porter to being a fighter finds himself knighted; when you see your character finally find themselves in the double digits, you can feel that they've earned the right to be considered a true hero. And one that doesn't require an entire sleepless night to pump out 3 pages worth of backstory either..",1

The other was as follows, a sorcerer played by DM's girlfriend, an artificer played the other player from the other group, a cleric played by the college friend, and an old friend of the DM played a fighter.  
First few sessions when pretty well, (Well, for a Struad campaign at least.) and we seem to work well. The first moment things went wonky was when my character died. Now, I will say this upfront, I try to play my character in how he or she would handle the situation. If that means my character does something I think is stupid but they wouldn't know it's stupid, I still do it. I can already hear the angry shout of Dumb PC. This leads to my first character death, kinda.  


We were stuck in an inn with Strahd outside while we were trying to keep the one NPC away from him. The rest of the party was batting down the door while I went with the NPC to the second floor in the ope to keep her safe. Strahd managed to charmed one of the players, allowing him to be invited in. The druid shouted he was getting in. My character, hearing this, decided to act quickly. He was an Aarakocra and decided that he needed to get the NPC out of there, from the second floor. So, he decided to try to fly out with the NPC. I manage to fly but because I failed a strength check, I dropped the NPC.  
Strahd saw this and order his right-hand man to take me out. Now I got it by his dart and the DM rolled fair on damage, which leads to my characters making death throws. I had one fail to save from falling. Now my brother tried to save me with a medicine check but was still a bear. So he failed, causing another fail death save. So I rolled my only saving throw and failed, causing death. So, I rolled up another character.  
My second character was a ranger and I will admit, kinda suck. At this time, I also couldn't play as much because I was cast in a play that ate a lot of time. So, I told the DM if he needed to do anything with my character when I wasn't able to play, it was fine. I manage to hop on one last game before tech week which resulted in my ranger getting capture to prevent our cleric from being discovered. So he informed me that my ranger got captured and the group was going to have to recuse her. I agreed to the idea and dive right into tech week.  
The next week, I'm informed that there was a chance my character could die and the DM asked if I was okay with that. I said it was fine and asked to just informed me if she died. The next time I talked to the DM, I learn that she died, kind of painfully from what I gather by context clues. So, again I roll up another character, this time a little determined to make sure the character wouldn't die so easily. I decided to make a paladin and this is when things start to get... difficult.   
After I roll my stats and introduce my character, the DM saw my stats and claim they were too high. Now my stats I'd rolled were 11, 14, 12, 10, 11, 10 and I was kind of confused because it wasn't that high. After that, he placed a rule that all new characters had to be point buy. I didn't raise a fuss because like I said, I was going to try to keep this character alive.   
A few sessions later, my brother and I have to do a solo session that resulted in getting us captured and the group having to rescue us. Now at first, since the party didn't see this ending well for them, (The whole town we got captured in a kind of hated most of the group due to past events. This is why my brother and I had to go because we were the only ones that the town wouldn't kill on sight.) The group was going to leave to die when the DM interject with a new rule to make death more effective. He instated that players get two free death then a penalty will be given.  
The first penalty will be your character will start with none of the starting equipment. The next time, the character will start one level lower than the rest of the party. And so on with that. As you can guess and if you're doing the math, you will notice that I'm the person who will suffer the most from this rule. I was against the rule when it was first put in but the party agreed to the rule due to most going by DM make the final say.  
Now by some miracle, my brother and I manage to get saved but the rule stays up. I, once again, didn't make a big fuss because I figured I could talk to the DM privately.  You see since my first character was killed by bad luck and I wasn't even in control when my second character died. I believe that I could present this argument for at least one freebie because I also tend to have the bad luck of dice rolls and I didn't want to hinder the party in case I died.  His response was less than stellar. He immediately rejected to augment and also mock me for my concern. I dropped it because I didn't want to ruin my brother's first time playing.  
The next few session go by and my Paladin is put through hell. We go to the Amber Temple way under level and I tried to keep the group from splitting up, (which of course happen) and if you know anything about the Amber Temple, then when my character died because one of the other players got curse and went power hunger, it's no surprise. But this time, the cleric was able to bring me back. The DM said that since I died I need to take a mental penalty. But instead of rolling for it, he chooses, ""You trust no one except for one person you can only see.""  
I work with this, role played with it by figuring that a paladin will see his god and since then, has lost a lot of faith in the group. Then he almost got killed by the abbot which lead to him becoming more depressed. But I soldier on, trying to keep going but I will admit, playing this character was becoming a pain. Where now we get to the latest session.  
So, after dealing with a large den of werewolves, we recently got a tome of Struad. At the same time, our cleric started hallucinating and hearing Struad in their head. After freaking out and having to be drug to sleep. Due to the cleric being the only other character that was nice to the paladin and brings him back from the dead, I realize he would try to at least get them better. So, he decided to contact Struad.  
Now, to describe encounters with Struad before this point, he never really try to hurt the party. At most he was a nuisance but sometimes help the party. I figure I could use the book to bargain for him to stop tormenting the cleric. He also decided to do it alone because he literally could not trust anyone in the party due to the flaw that was given. The worst I thought that could happen was it would be something was something that Struad would hold over my character or something along those lines. What ended up happening was Struad straight-up attacked my character without a second thought. I didn't even get a chance to really fight back and offer the book straight up to try to stop it. Still attack without a second thought and left me for dead with two failed death save. He then went to the party and took it peacefully without attacking anyone else.  
I rolled my death save and, of course, failed. So, I have to roll a character with no starting equipment. Now, why am I bring this up now is in two-part. The first part is the group has talked about continuing with our characters in homebrew and so when my character died I figure the rule might have been lifted. Nope, just like last time. The second part is I was talking about these games with a couple of coworkers who are big D&amp;D player. When I brought the rule the DM has made and they both started telling me I need to leave the group because they think it most targeted at me.  
My main question is should I leave this group because of the DM? I do enjoy most of the people in the group and I also introduce my brother to D&amp;D with this group. and I know most of the time people suggest talk to the DM but as I said before, I tried to and it results in ridicule. Any advice would be appreciated and if I'm overreacting, please tell me if I am.",1
DnD,socialfoxes,4,"Would you say that Orcs hold the position of Gladiator in high regard? Hi, 

I am working more on my characters, and I have gone back to a one that I was making a little while ago, to flesh him out more.  He was initially a prisoner/slave of a band of Orcs, but he was a decent fighter for his age and was able to put on a good show, so they kept him alive as they enjoyed making him fight and watching his performances.

My question is; would Orcs hold the position of Gladiator in high regard, because I thought that through his performances, the character could have gained some measure of social status amongst the Orcs by being a good fighter and a decent showman?

Does this sound like something that might happen in standard Orc society of conventional realms based worlds?

DnD,nerdCaps,1,"Never talk to strange ravens... Proud of myself for this one. 

The Setup: My party includes a Ranger who loves to Speak with Animals. He talks with them all the time, including to send messages to a forest patron which the party has become involved with. The party also just left a town where the BBEG resides, though they aren't sure exactly who it is. However, they know they are there, they know they need to be stopped, and they know the element of surprise will be helpful in this regard.

What they don't know is the BBEG has been spying on them through use of a disguised [Kuunganisha](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/fiends/kuunganisha/), a gift from the BBEG's patron deity. To blend in, the fiend flies around under the guise of a raven.

The scenario: The party has just defeated a group of anti-paladins, posing as members of the Royal Guard set to take the team to the Big City. The battle was fun, but the party was concerned about next steps. Once they settled on a plan, they realized the path forward would delay the side quest they had been tasked with by their forest patron. So, the Ranger casts Speak with Animals with the intent of sending a message to the patron.

Instead of an owl or some other bird, I had the Kuunganisha - disguised as a Raven - land near him and ask for the message. The Ranger paused for a moment (""Odd to see a Raven out at night, isn't it?""), but then continued to tell the fiend the party's entire plan, how they were going to kill the BBEG, what their suspicions were about the townfolk, etc.

I couldn't have planned it better if I tried.

After he sent off the 'Raven', he sent another message, and then scanned the area with Primeval Awareness (the first time he'd done it since the Kuunganisha started following them), and I let him know he sensed a Fiend, for a moment, before it disappeared from range (6 miles, favored terrain.) When he asked what direction, I fudged it and let him know it was moving back toward the town with the BBEG.

I ended the session shortly thereafter, but the chaos that ensued with the party realizing their entire plan had to be scrapped was something else.",1

DnD,RazarTuk,2,"In defense of critical confirmation rolls, and why 3e handled them incorrectly (x-post r/Pathfinder_RPG) We've all been there. You roll a natural 20 and get excited because you threatened a critical hit, but you fail the confirmation roll, your disappointment is immeasurable, and your day is ruined. Clearly, confirmation rolls are to blame, right? I looked at the math, and I don't think it's the mere concept of confirming criticals that's to blame. It's how we handle critical confirmation.

###Variables

`p` is the probability of rolling high enough on an attack roll to hit. Barring cases like 5e-style advantage, it will never go below 0.05 or above 0.95.

`c` is the probability of rolling a number in your critical threat range. This is *not* necessarily the probability of getting a threat under the current system. That's actually `min(c,p)`.

###A simple crit mechanic

The simplest crit mechanic we can make is just not confirming critical hits. If you roll in your threat range and it's high enough to hit, you get a critical hit. Your chances of getting some sort of hit are, of course, `p`, and your chances of getting a critical hit are `min(c,p)`. But if you look at the chances of any given *hit* being critical, as opposed to any given *attack roll*, it's higher. `c/p` if `c&lt;p`, or `1` if `c&gt;p`. If something's difficult enough to hit that you need that natural 20, or otherwise only hit on numbers in your threat range, 100% of attacks *that land* will be critical. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this, although it's a side effect that you should be aware of as a game designer. And more importantly, it's historically what critical confirmation rolls are trying to avoid.

Note: 5e technically adds ""Critical threat always hits"", and while 4e auto-*hits* on a 20, you actually need that 20 to hit naturally for it to be a critical hit.

###3.PF-style criticals

In 3.5 and PF 1e, criticals start out similar. If you roll in your threat range *and* you hit, you threaten a critical. But instead of automatically getting a critical hit, you roll a second time, and only if that attack also hits do you get a critical hit. Breezing through some of the numbers, your chances of hitting and not threatening a critical hit are `p-c`, your chances of threatening and failing to confirm are `c(1-p)`, your chances of hitting and doing regular damage are `p(1-c)`, your chances of getting a critical hit are `cp`, and your chances of getting a critical hit assuming you hit are `c`. 

That last number is the most notable. Whereas before, `c` was the chance of any given attack roll being critical, and the number of attacks that land that are critical increases the less likely you are to hit, `c` is now the chance that any given attack that hits will be critical. Except, it isn't.

If `p&lt;c`, that is, you can roll in your threat range and still miss, the numbers change. Your chances of getting a regular hit increase to `p(1-p)`, your chances of getting a critical hit drop to `p^2`, and the chances of any given hit being critical drop to `p`. You essentially miss out on critical hits, but to explain why, we need to look at an alternative system.

###Two-dice method

Under this variant, you always roll 2 d20s on attack rolls. One of them, the attack die, determines if you hit, while the other, the critical die, determines if you crit. The attack die follows normal rules for attack rolls, and if it hits *and* the crit die is in your threat range, you get a critical hit. If the attack die hits, but the crit die is outside of your threat range, it's a regular hit. And if the attack die misses, you miss, regardless of what the crit die says.

In the case that `p&gt;=c`, this is mathematically identical to the normal method, but in the case that `p&lt;c`, it keeps the chances of any given attack that hits being critical at `c`.

###Where that extra chance went

Your ""attack roll"" is actually the critical die. If you map the traditional method for confirming critical hits onto the two-dice method, the initial attack roll is actually the critical die, while the critical confirmation roll is the to-hit die. I even have [the diagram](https://imgur.com/a/6x8p6eo) to prove it.

Explanation of diagrams: 

* The horizontal axis is the result of the attack roll / critical die, where each box is a 10% chance

* The vertical axis is the result of the confirmation roll / attack die

* The solid horizontal line is the chance of the attack die hitting

* The solid vertical line is the chance of the crit die being in the threat range

* The dotted vertical line is the chance of the attack roll hitting

* The shaded region is the chances of getting a critical hit under normal rules

###How do we fix 3.5?

Well first of all, there's always the option of the two-dice method. And based on the surprising result that the attack roll is actually the critical die, I would interpret ""+X to critical confirmation rolls"" as ""If you threaten a critical hit, get a bonus to the attack die""

The issue is that because bonuses on confirmation actually mean that threatening a crit makes it easier to hit, the result of the attack roll depends on the result of the confirmation roll. So without transparency from the GM about enemy AC, there's no way to perfectly patch the existing system. But as an easy hotfix, you could add a rule that if you roll in the threat range on your critical confirmation roll, you automatically confirm the critical hit. You still lose out on ever so slightly many critical hits if you have a bonus to confirmation rolls and don't hit on your entire threat range, but overall, the numbers are much closer to what they theoretically are.

###How do we fix 5e?

If you care about this sort of thing and want critical hits to be a percentage of all attack that hit, rather than all attacks, just reintroduce crit confirmation. If your attack hits, you roll a second die to see if it's critical. If it comes up as a 20, it is, if it comes up anything else, it isn't. For Champion Fighters, Improved Critical applies to this second roll. 

###tl;dr

The point of critical confirmation rolls is nominally that the chances of rolling in your threat range become the chances that any given attack *that hits* is critical. Because of how the system currently works, though, you lose out on some critical hits if you don't hit on your entire threat range. An easy patch to the 3.PF rule that fixes the math for the vast majority of characters is that if you roll in your threat range on the confirmation roll, you still confirm the crit, even if it wasn't high enough to hit.",1

I'll be a helf-elf Acolyte(Luxonborn). I have 2 siblings and have a basic idea of my childhood/background. 

I was the youngest child. When my oldest brother was born, my mother's side of the family disowned her for being involved with humans (is this a possibility?) and abandoned us, so I never met her. My father raised us but when I was young (maybe less than 10?) he got involved with some criminal acts or with the wrong people and left me and my brothers at a temple to be raised by priests. I don't know his wherabouts.

These are my Personality traits:
 
&gt; I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen. Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.

**Ideals**
&gt; Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith‚Äôs religious hierarchy. (Lawful)
&gt; Bonds
Everything I do is for the common people.
&gt; Flaws
    I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.

DnD,Windspirit_wav,5,"Lessons I‚Äôve learned in my first year DMing. Please share any other lessons/funny realities of being a DM, whether you‚Äôre just starting out DMing, or been doing it for years or decades. I‚Äôd love to hear your stories and thoughts.

We were all new to D&amp;D except for one player who had been playing for nearly 20 years. He‚Äôs never played 5e, but he had way more experience than the rest of us, and to this day, I still go to him when I‚Äôm unsure of a ruling, or just need a sounding board. Without him, I would not have gotten as far as I have, and our first campaign would not have lasted as long as it has. (1.5 years, and we‚Äôre about to reach the climax of the campaign). 

So, here are a few lessons I‚Äôve learned in my first year as a DM, and more recently, a player.

1. Players will surprise you, and turn EVERYTHING you say into a joke, pun, or innuendo. EVERYTHING!

2. As per lesson one, don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously, and never marry yourself to an idea or plot point. Your BBEG will die sooner than you expect, and your carefully laid plans will go awry. Improvising your ideas and encounters a bit, and building them around your players actions and decisions will be much more rewarding to them, and it will help you get better in the future. Also, that Kobold you named ‚ÄúDumbdung‚Äù is going to be charmed and under the control of the party until he follows them around as an annoying squire, potentially used as cannon fodder. So, maybe don‚Äôt improvise everything... 

which leads us to...

3. PREPARE MATERIAL EVERY WEEK! Write. Keep a notebook and writing materials handy at all times. When an idea hits you, write that low hanging fruit down! I‚Äôve come up with one shots in afternoons (not great ones, but good), just because I had a good idea, and built around them. Prep time is your friend. Even if 90% of the material gets scrapped because that one side quest didn‚Äôt work out, you can reuse these ideas later, or use them for inspiration when it becomes relevant. The more you prepare, the more seamless your game will appear, even if it‚Äôs a hodgepodge of BS from 2 weeks prior, it‚Äôs better than taking a break to come up with something for 30 mins, when you could have been rolling dice and role playing.

4. You don‚Äôt have to roleplay everything. I love RP. More than I should. My favorite interactions with the party are just them roleplaying on downtime. That said, it can bog your game down, and you may not accomplish or even touch what you set out to do that session. I fell into this put a few times in my first year when I started getting comfortable with the basics, and started making more NPCs. I overprepped my NPCs, and it really slowed things down, even if the players enjoyed the roleplaying. 

Which leads me to...

5. Learn your players‚Äô individual play style. There‚Äôs a great section on this in the DMG, but it doesn‚Äôt really cover how to interact with a player and their personal mix of different game styles. Always have combat prepared and respect for the murderhobo, and they‚Äôll show respect to other player‚Äôs roleplaying, storytelling, or exploration. In fact, they can help you keep momentum moving forward. Respect the combat nerds. Those who prefer action over thought are a godsend to DMs who struggle with keeping things moving.

6. Don‚Äôt be afraid to call people‚Äôs attention back to the game. Granted, it‚Äôs not fun to hangout with your friends unless you get off topic. But, you did all come together to play a game, and it‚Äôs your job as a DM to make sure that everyone has fun, but also is respected. I‚Äôve only recently felt confident enough to say ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs &lt;player‚Äôs&gt; turn right now. What do you do player?‚Äù when things get way off course. Keeping things focused is important. Just don‚Äôt let it become all about the game instead of hanging out with good friends.

7. Finally, player or DM wise, talk about the kind of game you want to play with your group before you get into the campaign. Session 0‚Äôs are more important than I ever imagined. Get to know each other as people, talk out what you want from the game, and feel out your players moods. Maybe role play a bit to see how characters feel to the players and the DM. We didn‚Äôt do a session 0 with our original campaign, and we just got lucky in that we all have somehow found a groove with each other that works. That campaign is nearly 2 years old and still going. That said, I‚Äôve tried running 3 other campaigns since then, and even with a session 0, they didn‚Äôt work out for one reason or another, simply because we didn‚Äôt communicate properly. Which, is sort of the biggest lesson I‚Äôve learned from playing, and now apply to real life. D&amp;D taught me to communicate, and interact with people confidently, and to listen. 

Please share your own experiences and lessons below. I‚Äôd like to learn from other new DMs and players, as well as veterans. Love one another, and RNGesus bless you.",1

DnD,BenjiLizard,9,"My player (level 7 mage) is trying to spellcraft I'm new to DMing and one of my players send me a message today to present me his concept for a spell he'd like to create for his character. I never done this so I'm not sure how to make sure it's not too broken... Here's the concept:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;PENDULUM OF PERDITION  
&gt;  
&gt;*level 3 - illusion*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 30 feet  
**Components**: V, S, M (a little pendulum)  
**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute  
You wave the pendulum toward a creature than you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or enter a state of confusion. At the begining of your turn, you can decide a direction the target has to move forward, if the target attempts to make a movement during its turn, it has to move in the direction you chose. After each movement, the target can attempt to break the spell with another saving throw. This spell can't affect blind creatures. 

What do you think? Does it sound to powerful? I think the concept is nice and it can be extremely useful in some situation but that it has some severe enough counters (creature simply chose to not move and use ranged attack insted) but I'm afraid to be a bit too green to see how broken it might be.",1

DnD,Growlithedude,15,"Demon Battle almost ruins the parties. A five man party comprised of a; Paladin, Sorcerer, Bard, Barbarian, and Fighter. They were on an island of a world I created called, Xenorth. Xenorth is full of Demons and even warns them of what is to come. So they reach a Demonic Summoning Ground, I describe what it's like there, ""The rotting smell of death hits your nostrils. It fills them in a sort of reversed euphoria. The sensation sends you over and causes you to gag. As you look closer though, you see fresh blood tunneling down to the circle."" After this they rolled a Constitution saving roll, and only the Bard failed. Then the Paladin rolled a perception roll, and got a 17, so I described to him what the first thing he saw was, which was a Demon ""Blood drips from it's tusks. It slowly marches towards you before it halts, staring, and snorting. It finally bounds towards you at an inhumane speed, it turns itself and goes to strike you with it's long blood stained claws."" It's stats were a bit high, just to show them how powerful they are

Health - 85, AC - 17, Str - 17, Dex - 16, Con - 18, Int - 12, Wis - 13, Cha - 5.

The fight started and Initative was not looking good for them. The Demon got to go first, and he already got 11 damage in on the Paladin. And he decided to attack the Bard with Eldritch Blast, dealing 18 damage. Basically knocking them down a good amount of HP since they only had 42. The Fighters turn was next and he went to Attack them. He got a good hit in, although all the demons in my game had a reaction called 'Retort' where if they're hit for over 10 damage, he turns on them and hits them with a claw attack, dealing 9 damage. They decided to run, and they left. As they were only level 13, fighting a 15th Level Demon. That is pretty much the entire story.",1
